	<h2>The Skiing Analogy</h2>
    	<p>Apologies for writing about such a middle class activity, but one of the most fascinating things I learned about the human brain I learned in a skiing lesson.</p>
<p>Basically, it's this: DO NOT LOOK AT THE THING YOU WANT TO AVOID.</p>
<p>It's fascinating because it's a clear reminder that the little dialogues in our heads are nothing in comparison to the ape-like urges. However much we look at a rock and say to ourselves, "See that rock? We need to go round that," chances are that we'll hit it.</p>
<p>And it applies everywhere. Look at social media. The Daily Mail publishes something typically dreadful and we all talk about it; we show our disgust for The Apprentice by watching it and talking about it; there's a hashtag about failings in the NHS and we make it trend by complaining about it. Yes, I do all these things.</p>
<p>Social media make us keep skiing into rocks when we should be concentrating on the clear paths, the better discussions, the more valuable uses of our time. Making things better. Making better things.</p>
