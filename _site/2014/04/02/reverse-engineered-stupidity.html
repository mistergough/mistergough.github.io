    	<p>Instead of imagining that we're creating perpetual engines with our ideas, a little push in the right direction to conquer the world, let's imagine that all ideas are fundamentally stupid and work back from their inevitable demise.</p>
<p>Here's a handy formula:</p>

<p>i = the level of investment required<br />
s = the stupidity of the idea<br />
t = the length of time you want people to think the idea isn't stupid</p>
<p>Note that s is squared. Stupid ideas have an exponential impact on everything.</p>
