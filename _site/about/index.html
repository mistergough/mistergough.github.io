	<h2>About</h2>
    	<p>I’m a design facilitator and maker whose work converges on three, overlapping areas: interactions, systems and self.</p>

<p><img src="http://mistergough.com/images/venndiagram.png" alt="Venn Diagram" /></p>

<p>Most of my work is carried out through <a href="http://redfront.co.uk">Redfront</a>, my human interaction agency. In addition to working for clients I spend my time creating new tools for design and sharing them with people; I’ve recently been involved with design projects for data, legal contracts, agile methodology and sharing startups.</p>

<p>As part of Redfront’s data interactions work I’m currently writing a book. The first version, with new tools and approaches for designing with data, will be out very soon. If you’re interested you can join <a href="http://eepurl.com/br95wv">the mailing list</a>. Redfront’s data exploration also led to me becoming a co-founder of Open Data Institute Node <a href="http://devon.theodi.org">ODI Devon</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://beyond.place">Beyond</a> is looking at how a better understanding of living systems can support more sustainable futures. We’re bringing together technology and data with design principles and developing new networks. We also run events, including last year’s Beyond the Smart City and the more recent <a href="http://beyond.place/thingscamp">ThingsCamp</a>. There will be another Beyond conference in the Autumn.</p>

<p><a href="http://theself.agency">The Self Agency</a>, which launched in April 2016 in Barcelona, is an opportunity to explore a real focus on the self and how this foundation can help support more human-scale projects.</p>

<p>That’s mostly it, although I’ve been helping individuals and businesses with digital and social for almost 20 years through <a href="http://imagetext.co.uk">imagetext</a>; I write a <a href="http://theminimallist.com">long-running blog</a> with my wife about all sorts of things; I’m developing <a href="http://learningoutsiders.com">online resources for unschooling</a>; and I’m a course tutor for the MDes in Service Design at Ravensbourne College in London.</p>
