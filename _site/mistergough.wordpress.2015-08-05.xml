  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I blog all over the place - for my work, for others, for projects. But this is where I write the random stuff. If you're looking for themes then you could look at the following places (not all my own work, some of them just a sprinkling):
<ul>
	<li><a title="Redfront" href="http://redfront.co.uk" target="_blank">Redfront</a> - my main business. Service Design, stuff with post-it notes, making things;</li>
	<li><a title="The Minimal List" href="http://theminimallist.com" target="_blank">The Minimal List</a> - a long-running blog about simplicity I write with my wife;</li>
	<li><a title="imagetext" href="http://imagetext.co.uk" target="_blank">imagetext</a> - my visual design business. I do graphic identities and clean, simple websites;</li>
	<li><a title="Learning Outsiders" href="http://learningoutsiders.com" target="_blank">Learning Outsiders</a> - a work in progress, imagining a world without school, to make education better;</li>
	<li><a title="Our Learning Website" href="http://http://learningoutsiders.com/ourlearningwebsite/" target="_blank">Our Learning Website</a> - where we do fun projects while everyone else is at school;</li>
	<li><a title="Handemic" href="http://handemic.com" target="_blank">Handemic</a> - doing mobile apps stuff; and</li>
	<li><a title="pop_up" href="http://http://popuphq.com/" target="_blank">pop_up</a> - not my idea. A project for creatives and geeks, started by Phillippa Rose, the other Redfront person.</li>
</ul>
So, there are lots of different things going on, but there is a simple idea running through it all. I like to make things better, simpler and for people. If you've made it this far why not follow me on <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/mistergough" target="_blank">Twitter</a>?]]></content:encoded>

I just spent 10 minutes showing my teenage nephew how to search for a better video player than the one that came with his computer, download and install it. He has a PC, I have a Mac. I knew nothing about playing video on PCs before about half an hour ago and yet here we are. He's fiddling with his new video player and I'm left wondering what people mean by "digital natives".

When people use that phrase it's usually to refer to younger people, people who have grown up with computers and the web and, somehow, have it in their blood. We assume that they instinctively know how to do anything on the internet. Well, from my experience of young people, they often don't.

This week saw some really exciting projects dreamt up by some intimidatingly young and talented people as part of <a title="Young Rewired State" href="http://youngrewiredstate.org/">Young Rewired State</a>. The projects seemed to confirm everything we like to think about young people: that they're creative, imaginative and whizzes with computers. From what I saw of the project, the young people involved are all of those things.

But they are just a subset of young people. Many of the young people involved in Young Rewired State seem to have developed their skills despite school rather than because of it. Regardless of what is being taught in the classroom those young people are passionate about computers and coding and creating things. And, of course, learning. They are driven, fascinated by the possibilities of technology.

But they are young people with a particular interest. And not necessarily representative.

So the whole idea of digital natives seems to me to be rather condescending. It devalues the young people who are passionate about technology by reducing everything they're worked hard to learn as merely something that's been absorbed from the world that adults have made for them. And it devalues the young people who aren't interested in technology by assuming they're into computers whether or not they are.

What's much more likely is that, as has ever been true, different people are absorbed by very different things. Being young is no more an indicator of computational prowess than being old means you don't know what VLC is.

Long may that be the case.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Influence</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been thinking about social influence for a while and I'm certainly not the only one. What the launch of new services all the time (Kred being the most recent one I know of) it seems that the market is developing at quite a pace.

But I saw a comment from someone recently that really made me stop and think. They were saying that in the future people would pay people for endorsements on the basis of their influence and I immediately had two thoughts:

1) I'm sure this is true.

2) It shouldn't be.

No two people are every going to agree how social influence works. Social business/media/commerce/networking/recruitment or whatever you're involved in are in a permanent state of flux. I wouldn't expect anyone to come out with the definitive, right or wrong answer on most topics in these fields but to me, the idea of paid influencer endorsements not only misses the whole point of social influence but is also symbolic of a wider misunderstanding of social.

The most famous examples of endorsements we have right now are those of celebrities. We don't bat an eyelid seeing David Beckam adding his name to aftershave, or marker pens, or trainers. And there's a reason for that. No matter what you think of David Beckham, his adverts for Sharpie do no harm to his standing as a football player. His reputation is built upon sporting prowess and extensions to his personal brand, made possible from his celebrity, do no harm to what makes him a celebrity in the first place.

The thing is, there's no such duality in social media. Influence on social media is built on trust. Whether or not you feel that you can measure that influence (and this is not a topic for this blog post), there's no doubt that cashing in on that influence is mutually destructive. It would be naive to suggest that there is no such thing as influence, clearly some people reach and affect more people than others. But it is not a commodity. The whole point of social, its core value, is that trust has to be earned and not bought. No the market is not perfect, and it's possible to build a great deal of influence out of very little integrity, but as I said before, the whole thing is in flux. At the heart of social is an understanding that, hopefully, these deceptive wrinkles will be ironed out and trust will win the day.

So, for me, the idea of monetising influence is shaky ground. I've no doubt that in the short term there's money to be made. But in the long term an unsophisticated adoption of this strategy is doomed to failure. i say unsophisticated becuase]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Marketing Basics for LinkedIn Spammers</title>
  <link>https://mistergough.wordpress.com/2011/11/12/marketing-basics-for-linkedin-spammers/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><em>A comment I posted earlier in response to some very un-targeted LinkedIn Group spam.</em></strong>

Hello, I'm not sure if you've posted this here by mistake, but it doesn't seem to fit with the theme of the group, so I'm assuming that you have.

Actually, this seems to be a common mistake, and one which I blame on the fact that marketing is not taught from an earlier age. I would like to see it on the primary school syllabus. OK, that may be going a bit far, but I really do love the subject. I'm a marketing fanboy.

I believe that a basic understanding of the discipline would dispel many of the myths surrounding it and lead to a more harmonious world in which people were free to engage with like-minded individuals without the fear of misguided interlopers muddying the proceedings.

Seth Godin wrote a very interesting book, some time ago now, in which he set out the differences between what he termed "permission marketing" and "interruption marketing". In fact, the book is called "Permission Marketing" and I highly recommend it.

As the title suggests, the book is all about how to develop good relationships, based on mutual respect (actually, it's about how to extract the most money from the fewest people but marketers like to keep that a secret). He clarifies that there is also a time and a place for interruption marketing but that it should fit with a wider approach that doesn't alienate potential customers.

Much of what he terms interruption marketing references established principles of the subject and, if you're keen to know more about some of the basics, I would recommend another book, "Marketing: Concepts and Strategies" by Dibb, Simkin, Pride and Ferrell. It's very old now, but it was the text I used as an undergraduate and it provides a great background reference.

Most importantly, this book talks about some of the principles of market segmentation, whether that be through the more traditional demographic segmentation or, more recently, psychographic segmentation. There's a lot of theory, as you can imagine, but the core idea is that you should aim to carefully target people who might have some interest in your marketing message.

Of course, things have moved on a lot since books like the one I've just mentioned. We're living in a social age and personal relationships are what business is all about (Permission Marketing was very focused on companies rather than individuals). Actually, personal relationships never lost their importance, but recent business history has seen them obscured.

Social technologies provide the means to cultivate those personal relationships again. And LinkedIn Groups, such as this one provide a forum in which we can all get to know each other a bit better and talk about things that interest us.

And that's why I'm so sure that you made some kind of mistake here. Looking back through the history of marketing (and it's been around a while) the insertion of your marketing message into this socially-driven corner of the web doesn't seem to fit with any recent marketing paradigms. In fact, it seems to hark back to what some marketing people refer to as the "sales era", and that went out of fashion a long time ago.

So, I thought it was only fair to point out that some error had been made. Of course, like so many problems, I believe that it presents a real opportunity. And, as it happens, I can provide a whole range of marketing services, rooted in the core principles of the subject and developed over many years at the coal face.

If you find that your marketing message isn't getting the response that you'd hoped then please feel free to get in touch. I'm sure I can help. Be aware though that I've posted this exact same response to other people, so I'm not even following my own advice. "Physician, heal thyself", as somebody once said.

So, the rather loose targeting of this message may mean that it's not of any real interest to you. If it's not then please feel free to ignore my advice. But if it strikes a chord then do let me know. I'm all about building a rapport.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Complexity Costs</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Closed organisations require complexity to survive. They need to protect themselves and their IP, they need to reduce costs, and they need customer acquisition and retention. All of these functions require levels of complexity.

The bigger a closed organisation gets the more it needs to dedicate resources to its own complexity. There's a complexity cost, the cost of doing everything required just to exist as an organisation without actually delivering a direct benefit to its users.

The cost of delivering user benefit is service cost. The higher the complexity cost the fewer resources are available for service costs.  Hence why my five phone calls to Vodafone have failed to sort out a simple problem. It's not that Vodafone is under-resourced. It's simply mis-resourced.

Businesses grow until the complexity cost is as high as it can be maintained. In other words when the service cost has been reduced to its absolute minimum and it can get hold of enough resources to survive.

Logically, all large, closed, complex organisations will grow to the point where they only serve themselves. This is a problem inherent in all public-facing, closed organisations. Ivan Illich's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deschooling_Society" title="De-Schooling Society" target="_blank">De-Schooling Society</a> talks about precisely this problem.

Traditionally, closed organisations been good vehicles for making money. And making money helps to build the complexity required to grow. Closed organisations can also have lots of clever systems. The side effect of all the layers of complexity and need to reduce service costs is lots of systems. When you want to grow by processing users with systems instead of growing to benefit users with service, a closed organisation is the way to go.

Closed organisations can be money-making, systems-driven processing machines. And for long periods of time they can be unbeatable. The huge, complex, closed organisations of recent years, like Microsoft, Google, Apple and now Facebook are testament to this. 

The real danger for closed organisations is their complexity cost. This <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2010/04/the-collapse-of-complex-business-models/" title="Collapse of Complex Business Models" target="_blank">Clay Shirky article</a> talks about the precarious position of complex organisations. Interestingly, one of his illustrations of complex organisations being disrupted is the film industry. He talks about the disruptive power of Youtube, which of course is part of Google. So in reality one complex system has been disrupted by another complex organisation.

The key point, however, is that it's the internet that has disrupted the film industry. The internet enables people to create their own content. The internet can enable us to do just about anything. It's also very good at enabling complexity. Three of the four businesses mentioned above have seen their greatest successes because of the internet.

But this success is just a blip. Just as the internet is good at allowing complex organisations to grow quickly, it's also good at dismantling them. Today's big, closed organisations are more vulnerable than any big organisations in history. As much as the internet is a petri dish for complex organisations, it's also pretty much inert and doesn't guarantee the survival of anything.

Big organisations know this. They survive day-to-day through an ongoing process of just enough innovation to keep everyone happy and as much control as they can get away with. Google gives us free stuff for using its services and locks us into its search engine through ubiquity. Facebook gives us social toys and makes sure that we're sharing our lives with enough people we like to stay loyal. Apple gives us shiny things and locks us into two-year contracts and eco-systems to make sure we never leave.

Facebook's recent "de-risking strategy" (developing new services to protect their growth ahead of IPO) is perhaps an outward sign of a complex organisation panicking. The trends in social networking are turning away from Facebook (and Google). The market is maturing and people are starting to use smaller, niche services for different things. And this user-level simplification, choosing precisely what services we need is a massive threat to companies like Facebook.

Ultimately there's every chance that the simple, indestructable nature of the internet will conquer the complex organisations that have built themselves upon it. At the very least, complexity costs will become less and less sustainable and closed organisations will have to find new models to grow. Ultimately perhaps the way we use the internet will properly mirror the way the internet is built: simple, node-to-node and with endless possibilities.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Love this post Simon! In simplicity we trust! Your synopsis of how organisations work is precise. Using complexity to control. Organisations lifecycle's start in a simple, amoeba like mode, move to a complex one which sustains them (well shareholders) for a short while and then something comes along to completely disrupt the complex nature of their innovation, just because they can. Its called getting left behind! Social networking companies are no different, they still operate in a market society after all!]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment, Ann. I think the next few years will be particularly interesting as we see huge companies have to deal with an increasingly fast cycle of complexity and disruption. I know I'm biased, but I really believe that companies with a better balance between internal complexity and customer service might ride out some of the more challenging conditions.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The hardest thing in business is to know what you're selling. Maybe it's not glamorous, sitting around trying to work out what it is that you sell when it should be so obvious, but it's not obvious.

In pretty much every single business the thing that you're selling is not physical at all. Whether you make phones, or food, or bricks, or provide services, ultimately everyone is selling the same thing - experiences.

This is a good and a bad thing.

It's good because experiences are multi-faceted, exciting, different for everyone and infinitely customisable.

It's bad because experiences are ephemeral, hard to get right and potentially impossible to manage.

But what's really great about experiences is the fact that they are most of your marketing. While everyone else is running around creating more and more elaborate ways to promote their stuff and drilling down further and further into data, you can stop and think about what you're really selling. And when you know what you're really selling everything else falls into place.

If you're still stuck it helps to remember that what you're selling isn't really something you create at all. Customers create their own experiences for you. This isn't the same as selling people what they want. That kind of marketing wouldn't create much of any real value.

Instead you should be using the resources you have to enable people to create the experiences they want. Even better would be enhancing the experiences people want to create with whatever resources you can access.

Hopefully, of course, in return for money. Or at the very least fierce loyalty.

From here on it's all plain-sailing. Do the methods you use to communicate improve those experiences? If not, then drop them. Do the things you actually make create those experiences? If not, then make something else. It's so much more effective to protect the experiences and tinker with the products than it is to sell the same old thing and "manage expectations".]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Collaborative Consumption Myth</title>
  <link>https://mistergough.wordpress.com/2012/02/23/the-collaborative-consumption-myth/</link>
  <pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2012 13:26:22 +0000</pubDate>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been reading a lot about Collaborative Consumption recently. And talking about it, and thinking about it but it still leaves me puzzled. As much as I want to believe in the power of peer-to-peer I keep coming back to the same concerns.

There's a theoretical issue when it comes to the core idea of collaborative consumption. In many ways I think society is less peer-to-peer than ever. Increasingly, the things we do are moderated, interfaced, organised and ultimately controlled by third parties. In many cases by huge, un-democratic third parties.

To me, the irony of collaborative consumption is that society started out that way. In the most basic of market economies we traded between ourselves, locally and organised our own resource eco-systems. Industrialisation, economies of scale, division of labour and all the other elements of economic development have merely sought to streamline and commoditise these basic transactions. And this continues. We want more and more conversations so we get new platforms. We want to trade more and more items so we get online marketplaces. The move to efficiency and scale continues.

Then I look at the examples of collaborative consumption that are offered. I see names like <a href="http://www.ebay.com/" title="eBay" target="_blank">eBay</a>, <a href="http://www.airbnb.co.uk/" title="AirBnB" target="_blank">AirBnB</a> and <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/" title="Zipcar" target="_blank">Zipcar</a>. Is any one of these a co-operative, not-for-profit, customer-owned social enterprise? No, not one. Many of them are large, highly profitable businesses, or at least heading that way. I'm not saying that for collaborative consumption to exist it must be about non-profit. But I fail to see how the arrival of new companies designed to sell new services in this marketplace heralds the arrival of a new social paradigm.

In other words, rather than collaborative consumption as a peer-to-peer revolution, it seems to me that collaborative consumption is the name given to the process of monetising and up-scaling what people already do. The shift is not a societal transformation but a simple extension of the parameters of industrialisation. Now businesses own our conversations and the sale of our own unwanted goods. Craigslist is an extension of newspaper classifieds. eBay is the new auction room. Where is the consumption revolution exactly?

At the extreme, perhaps collaborative consumption is regressive. By endorsing a massive centralisation of human interactions we're handing over more power than ever. We're allowing businesses to own more and more of us. I'm not even saying it's a bad thing. But what I am saying is that we should know what we're doing and give it a proper name that reflects this. We should drop the utopian vision of non-hierarchical, democratic, peer-to-peer revolution and either accept what we've made or make something that is genuinely revolutionary.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Interesting view, but I wonder if there's more than a touch of the straw man here. EBay as a CC platform? I don't consume stuff of ebay in collaboration with anyone else, it's a straightforward sale between two independent parties. Sure we flag the seller as trustworthy but that is collaborative marketing rather than consumption, surely.

For me the best example I can think of is when people live-tweet comment on the TV they are watching. That enhances the experience of watching TV and you start to consume it in a social way.

I agree that in these cases our conversation is intermediated by a large unaccountable 3rd party company (Twitter). But they do at least get out of the way at such times...]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment. I agree that eBay doesn't really seem much like collaboration but it is one one the primary examples used and one which sets off the alarm bells for me.

I like the live tweeting example, but again (I know you acknowledge this) there is a large company making this activity possible. I guess my real issue is whether the very concept of peer-to-peer is actually viable. Any kind of mass-participation needs structure. And structure breeds hierarchy. Ultimately it seems to me that collaborative consumption simply can't exist as the concept people present it as. In most cases it seems to be just a misleading term for incremental business efficiency improvements.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Have to write an essay on hyper consumption. Stumbled upon that book about collaborative consumption. It appears to be a positive spin on hyper consumption . People naturally look for positives in the negative things in their lives and collaborative consumption is simply a false positive drawn from hyper consumption. What you wrote was helpful, and one of the few sources on the net not stating the revolutionary wonders of collaborative consumption.

  <title>Stimulation</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Searching news sites for the word "economy" gives you all the expected results. Jobs, companies, GDP of course, and articles about banks and the government. So are these things The Economy?  When the government talks about stimulating The Economy what economy are they talking about?

The Economy is increasingly a stock phrase for commerce, buying, selling, wealth and, above all, business. But these things aren't really The Economy. They're factors in it, indicators of it and outputs from it, but they're not actually The Economy.

The first book on economics that I ever read was a short paperback. It was light on Keynes, calculus, game theory and graphs. In fact it was pretty light on all the things I might now associate with economics. But it was a great introduction, and I learnt that economics is essentially the study of limited resources. No mention of money, business, tricky mathematics or banks (they were to come).

If economics is the study of limited resources then The Economy must just be our most limited, and therefore precious, resources.  At its most basic it's a collective term for the land, the time we have available and, above all, people.

So, it seems a little disconnected, the way the news talks about The Economy, like it's just companies and money. These things aren't the real economy. Stimulating business, the money supply and the markets is just an abstraction. Real economic stimulation comes from thinking about the important resources.

Putting land and time aside for now, economic stimulation really comes down to how you look after the people. It comes down to helping them (us) get what they (we) need, like inspiration, confidence, self-worth, happiness, belief in others, and a good reason why they (we) should go out and do things. Like build a better economy.]]></content:encoded>

I don't think you are just talking about stimulation, I think you are also talking about value.

  <title>Social Versus Authentic</title>
  <link>https://mistergough.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/social-versus-authentic/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Can we be "authentic" on social networks? Actually what do we mean by authentic? I'm guessing that when people talk about authenticity on social networks they're referring to people being genuine, being themselves.

The problem is, when are we actually ever ourselves? And do we want others to be themselves? In order to engage socially with others we have to accept that there is a degree of compromise. Social interaction necessarily transforms us. Do you really share with people exactly what you're thinking? Or do you miss bits out, enhance the less interesting elements?

<a title="Tim Southcombe's blog" href="http://www.codedefied.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tim Southcombe</a> made an interesting point in that the only way we can really get to know someone is over an extremely long time, face-to-face. And only, which is the really important bit, because at times they will let their guard down. So, really getting to know someone is about seeing the bad bits, the vulnerable times. And only because you're close enough to someone for the holes to appear.

Vulnerability and failure on social networks are nothing more than projected vulnerability and failure. You can choose to show the negative, painful things about yourself, but it is a choice. And a choice based on what will fit within your particular tribes. In the same way that the human mind cannot produce randomness, it cannot help but shape what it communicates to others.

Vulnerability and failure are part of it, but what about opinion? Who tells friends, or even just acquaintances, that the design work they've just done is dreadful? Who dares to argue with people that everyone else agrees with? We might all do this by degrees but who really talks nothing but their absolute truth?

So, we need to accept that, at the very least there are two sides to us. There's the private side and the public side. Perhaps the increasingly open world will make our private and public sides more similar. Perhaps the "always on" scrutiny will force these two identities apart. Either way, it seems hard to imagine a future where we are not shaped by the very nature of socialising. And surely this makes the notion of authenticity on social networks fundamentally flawed.

Perhaps what we need to be thinking about is how we can make our "authentic" selves more social, rather than our social selves more authentic.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm not an art critic and nobody gives a toss about my opinion of art, but I went to see the Damien Hirst exhibition and I thought I might as well write something about it.

I grew up with Damien Hirst. Not literally, although he was apparently born in Bristol, not a million miles from where I was born, but in the sense that I've been more aware of him as a living artist during my lifetime than almost anyone else. Particularly, throughout the late eighties and early nineties he was a sort of bad boy of British art. I hesitate to use the phrase "self-styled" because he was about as self-styled as the Beastie Boys. Like any artist nowadays his image owes as much to the press as anything else.

Before I go on I'll admit that I've always liked his work. In many ways he's the ultimate conceptual artist. Most of his work has an unflinching clarity of thought and he seems obsessed in going for the big topics. Pretty much everything he's ever made is about life, death or money. And very little of it is subtle.

But after visiting the Tate exhibition there are two things that I thought I wanted to write about:
<ol>
	<li>His work pretty much sums up the period.</li>
	<li>His work is deliberately too perfect.</li>
</ol>
<strong>His Work Pretty Much Sums Up the Period</strong>

I remember the late eighties and early nineties as being a period of absolute excess. I don't just mean in the obvious ways, like with the Yuppies and the money, but in that it was also a period of incredible creativity (no, not the New Romantics). It started out with lots of energy and ended up mired in its own success. It was a big decade (or so).

My favourite piece in the whole exhibition, the cow's head with flies, is a bit like a mirror on that time. It starts out with so much promise and ends up with the death of that promise. What else can you say about that? Well, maybe a bit more. Life and death itself is not a particularly original theme, but the sheer excess of life and death is worth contemplating.

Imagining everything being born and everything dying in this way is such a ridiculous, over-the-top representation of the life-cycle that only that period could have produced it. And many of his pieces are like that. They explore themes that have been central to art since time began but present them eighties/nineties-style. It's not just life and death, it's electric/neon/polka-dot life and death.

On one hand it's excess but on the other it's completeness, symmetry. The execution is as complete as the concept. And that brings me on to the second thing.

<strong>His Work is Deliberately Too Perfect</strong>
The symmetry of his work is stamped all over everything. Every piece in the exhibition is like some sort of bejewelled sledgehammer, such a perfect encapsulation of the thought behind it that it is too perfect. Because there is a problem with perfection in art. Perfection is like solving a puzzle, and once a puzzle is solved there is nothing left to talk about. In many ways perfection is the nemesis of art.

Seeing such perfect pieces of work reminded me of something else I was doing this week. I was showing my daughter some posters by Josef Muller-Brockmann and getting her to think about design. We were talking about how graphic design is supposed to get across a clear message. It's about simplicity. Muller-Brockmann was extraordinarily good at that kind of simplicity and one of the key tools he used to achieve that was the grid.

[caption id="attachment_141" align="alignleft" width="201" caption="Schutzt Das Kind!"]<a href="http://mistergough.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/jmbposter.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-141" title="Schutzt Das Kind!" src="http://mistergough.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/jmbposter.jpg?w=201" alt="Schutzt Das Kind!" width="201" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

The grid in graphic design is an amazing thing. It brings clarity of presentation, it helps to make everything logical. But the most important thing about the grid is that you're not supposed to stick to it. One of my favourite posters by Muller-Brockmann is the motorbike racing towards the boy. It's a very simple image but the tension in it - tension derived from messing with the grid - is extraordinary. In just one picture Muller-Brockmann makes the boy both the focus of the message and the most vulnerable thing on the poster.

Hirst uses the grid a lot too. His pill pieces and the pharmacy room, not to mention the spot paintings, are all grid-based. He even takes living animals and processes them in a way to bring a kind of mathematical coldness to them. And that just re-enforces the message of all his work. Everyone is born and everyone dies. In doing this he makes no attempt to break the grid. Everything is as it is, clinical.

Does that give me something to think about? Yes, it does. But largely not his actual work. His work deliberately answers his own questions. He's almost saying, "Here's life. Now move on". There's a massive inevitability to it all. It even extends to the comic. In one room we see cupboards full of implements designed to save lives and make us better. In another room is a big ashtray, the ultimate symbol of our desire to kill ourselves. Hirst takes the futility of life and makes it seem even more futile, bordering on stupid.

And, of course, he pokes fun at money. As you go through the exhibition you see some of the ideas recycled, but recreated more expensively. One of his first works, a hairdryer with a ping pong ball hovering over it, is remade with a beach ball and a massive multicolour box. The diamond-encrusted skull is perhaps the ultimate symbol of money as art but some of the other pieces are more of a witty statement.

In one room he re-creates the butterfly pictures, but adds in some jewels and puts them on a gold background. He even rotates the picture to make it a diamond shape. It makes a feature of a complete lack of new ideas, re-packaged with added bling. Maybe he's taking a swipe at the Renaissance or perhaps he's just rephrasing the eternal question of whether artists need to be poor and suffering to be any good. It's certainly hard to separate the business of his art from the art itself. And deliberately so.

So, there are things to think about but, like I said, what it really makes me think about is something outside of his work. It makes me think about what happens when we break the grid. Muller-Brockmann breaks it for us, he clarifies everything, but Hirst never breaks the grid. By presenting such completeness of idea and reality he wants us to think about whether life is really how he presents it. Are we like the flies and the butterflies or can we break the grid of life and death?

I can really see why Damien Hirst divides opinion. You can see him as a money-grabbing narcissist churning out big, shouty stuff for rich, soulless collectors. You can treat him as the ultimate symbol of eighties/nineties' art - all show and no substance. But this is not how I see Hirst in the same way as this is not how I see the period in which he was at his height.

There is certainly an inevitability about him. That period had to produce an artist like Hirst. But I don't think he's a pointless, commercial showman at all. If you at least give him credit for producing work that makes us think about other things, about what life could be like rather than what it seems to be then he's already achieved something. But I'd go further than that. I like to think of him as an artist who did exactly what artists are supposed to do - explore their world in order to make us think about our own.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hmm. Interesting. Well-written post. I like the safety poster.
It's very difficult to see Hirst's work without knowing about the excessive amounts of money for which his work sells. I think that when art historians look back on his work, they'll see it more as a phenomenon and less interesting than that by many of his contemporaries.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>The Happiness Product</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERbvKrH-GC4

I love this video of an Alan Watts talk. I've shared it before elsewhere, but its always worth revisiting. To me it says that happiness (or success, recognition, achievement) is presented as a product that we "save up" for. And what keeps us going, what motivates us, is that this happiness product is always close. Every time we reach a certain point in getting near to it the product moves away slightly, but we can accept it because we're making progress.

At first Watts' views seems to contradict the notion that the best years of our lives are at school, but in reality both of those ideas are along the same lines. Whether happiness (or whatever you aim for) is inextricably linked to a past period in life we all share, or something in the future we're all striving for it's still a "thing". It's a product, understandable, tangible. We either have it or we don't.

In reality I suspect that nearly all of us are unhappy some of the time. Some of us may be unhappy a lot. But we're probably a lot less happy when we see happiness as a thing or a product. Treating happiness as product detaches us from it. It's much more outside our control. When happiness is a product it means that any slight unhappiness is a sign that we're not happy at all.

It's hard to fight this view of the happiness product. Products are the easiest things for others to sell to us. And once they're in this form they can be cross-sold with anything, any other product we can imagine (the Perfect Body, the Dream Job). We'll even buy into the promise that the happiness product is available years down the line, when we have the qualifications and the job and the family.

But striving for the happiness product makes us dis-satisfied with the happiness experience, and this is what Alan Watts is trying to get across. The reality is that the happiness product doesn't exist. The happiness product is something so heavily over-sold that it costs more than anyone can afford. Which is all to say that happiness is being sold as diamonds, when actually it's nothing more than air.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes it's hard to put the effort necessary into deciding whether to follow someone on Twitter. For those times when I'm a bit pushed I use a simple reference for making the decision. It's purely based on the numbers of Followers and Followees so it's not very scientific. For those of you that want to be equally unscientific I've provided a chart.

Obviously this is under development so if you have any stereotypes to add please let me know. Once finished I hope it will save me the job of reading the tweets of anyone I don't know.

  <title>Consumption, Creation and Art Spaces</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[There's lots of discussion around consumption versus creation. We worry that schools teach about products when they should be teaching about processes, or that our culture is still dominated by mass consumption platforms.

But you could argue that consumption and creation are just two sides of the same coin. They're so closely related that people will find the tools/means/inspiration to create, whatever the circumstances. If you can make just a little space, allow just a little freedom, people will get on with it.

The thing we should really be worried about is not <em>whether</em> people create or consume things but <em>where</em> they create and consume them. If people need just a little space and freedom to create things then the nature of that space and freedom becomes all important.

The internet provides brilliant examples of these different spaces. On the surface every idea, every app seems to be tinkering around the edges of a single reality. This new social networking platform is a bit like that social networking platform. But take two fairly recent examples, Pinterest and Instagram and think about what spaces they inhabit.

Pinterest is a great example of the self-referential model of the internet. It provides an efficient machine for recycling, organising and curating content. It draws us further in. In contrast Instagram occupies a very different space. It sends us out into the world to look, explore our surroundings. Its digital manifestation is just a driving mechanism, a backbone.

In many ways Pinterest and Instagram couldn't be more different, and all because the spaces are so different. You could argue that one is more about creation than the other but I don't think that's the important issue. It's all about where they take us, not the means of travel.

I was lucky enough to spend much of my early working life with a contemporary dance company. I got to be with artists, dancers, musicians and the artistic process every single day. I saw new pieces go from an idea to a finished performance and was part of the journey that made that happen.

I felt privileged to be part of that, but in reality we can all have our share of that experience if we look for it. After all, seeing a play makes you part of it. Being in a rehearsal makes you part of the process that creates a finished piece, however small that part.

In fact, any kind of exposure to live art makes you a participant. And if you participate in something you shape it. So, when it comes to live art that consumption/creation distinction gets blurred.

I don't believe that there's a real substitute for this participation. Recorded, packaged representations of that play, that rehearsal are good, but the danger is that people start to think that they're good enough. And ultimately, putting resources into changing the space for art takes resources away from putting people in the art space.

So, I think it's great to see new, digital spaces for art but I wonder what this means for getting people out in the real world, watching rehearsals, seeing live plays. Are the new spaces for art going to be more like Pinterest or Instagram? In other words, are they going to draw us in or send us out?]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is a very interesting post, Simon, on a subject which is complex to describe.

While discussing the activities of creation, curation and consumption, it seems primarily to be dealing with the issue of the value attributed to each activity, including to its purpose and to the meaning that is created or consumed. However, is the space in which these activities occur only a quantitative issue of having sufficient space? Or is it also a qualitative issue, as the context which it provides is necessary for both the generation of content from meaning during creation, and for the attribution of meaning to content during consumption, with the intermediate activities of curation allowing manipulation of content to provide filtering, amplification and potential distortion of meaning?

Your specific point about the contrast between live and recorded performances is also interesting, with there being value of different kinds in each. Of course, there have been productions of recordings (whether "studio" or "live") of music, acting, sport, etc. for decades as alternatives, or in addition, to real live viewing and participation. The characteristics of each depends, in general, on the synchronicity and reciprocity of the communication between participants; and these are likely to continue to vary between types of content and of channel, as technologies for content acquisition, storage, communication and reproduction are deployed.

As your examples illustrate, this is not likely to stop any time soon!]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks, John. I think that the quality over quantity issue is even more pertinent now that we have ostensibly unlimited space on the internet to explore content. What matters is that people start thinking about what the simple mechanisms of interaction mean for the relationship we have with content in the same way as different channels for music drastically change our relationship with it, as in your example.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday I found out that someone I followed on Twitter closed their account and left the platform for good. They weren't a friend of mine, in fact I didn't really know them at all. I've never met them and I have no knowledge of their life. 

I'm sure this person had a good reason for leaving and, obviously it's up to them what they do online. For them Twitter wasn't really working out. In itself it's a sharp reminder of how hard it is to put ourselves in other people's shoes. We can't even get inside the experience another person is having, let alone inside their head.

All I can really understand is my own experience and it's a pretty roller coaster one at that. In this case the departure of the person in question has affected the way Twitter feels for me. 

The loss of one person out of the hundreds I follow has made me think about what I value on Twitter. In reality the conversations I have are with a very small group of people. And that small group of people provides me with a rich set of varied experiences, each of which means something important to me. 

I often think about a post-platform world, where I'm using little bits of everything to maintain conversations with the people that matter. I think it's inevitable. But, for me, right now, Twitter is the sticking point in all of that visioning. In my life Twitter is a backbone of all the other services I use. I believe it has a more personal feel than anything else. But then maybe that's just my experience. 

What I do know is that the personal experience has been emphasised by one person's departure and this disruption has made me revisit what I want out of all these social networks. It's not a revelation, I've been thinking about where I should put my efforts for a while. But the logical clarity it's brought is timely and useful. 

So I'm going to do what I tell everyone else to do. I'm going to really think about what I get out of all these things. I've got no real criteria for judging things. There are no metrics. The business measurement of social media is actually pretty easy. But personal ROI, what is that? How can I apply critical thinking to something as personal as social experience?

I suppose the only way forward is socially. I'd love to know what you think. Have you considered what you're doing on all these things? What you get out of it? Help!]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks, Janet. I always try not to self-censor on Twitter but I think it's pretty much impossible for all but the most determined users. I am aware that my somewhat random style doesn't do much in a business sense but I am generally pleased with the range of people following me. My challenge for now is to put more effort into my "corporate" accounts.

Outside of Twitter my current favourites are Instagram and Pinterest (steeped in possibility), although I try to focus on LinkedIn too because I'm supposed to. :)

I agree that Twitter has changed a lot, although I do think it has kept much of its soul. The fact that it ever had a soul says a lot about how different is it from so many other platforms.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks. I completely agree with the online/offline thing. This has been one of the most amazing things about Twitter for me.

I personally don't think that there is such a thing as a banal tweet. If anything, I find the endless posting of links to the same old articles about the same old things banal, whereas knowing what people are thinking and doing is fascinating. I guess that makes me different from "power users".]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm missing that person who left Twitter. It won't be the same without him. I think that I do understand why he left. I think that someone else with whom I've chatted for at least a couple of years might have left but for very different reasons. Twitter feels very different now to 3 years ago. I miss the light-hearted banter of those days when there were far fewer of us and it was more personal than corporations and brands and businesses. I miss the Saturday morning chatter about music with interesting people who now have far too many followers to have time for simple connecting through popular culture. There are 2 or 3 people from then who virtually never communicate with me now, and I do miss them. Some don't tweet as much - maybe because they're very busy or perhaps their bosses are online. 
There are certain tweets that I feel would be inappropriate in front of some followers, so I self-censor. I'm also careful not to set off Twitterstorms. There are things that I would like to say but I don't because I think it might get picked up in the wrong way. Some days, I worry that I'm becoming very dull and over-sensible. Some days, I think I might revive one of my other Twitter identities and be the more light-hearted me.
I decided a while ago that I would focus more on Twitter and Flickr.
Facebook - I use sparingly, mainly to keep in touch with a couple of my oldest friends, connect with various museums etc, and to access some other things that need FB authorisation. 
G+ - might use more if other people I knew use it more, but I really dislike the way a minority of men are using it and have had to block a few. I recently heard something a hangout that was disrupted in a very unpleasant way that makes me more concerned.
Linkedin: not sure how to use except to connect with people and to have my info in a place where I know people will look to find out more about the professional me. 
Instagram &amp; Path don't really work for me because I can only use free wifi when I'm out and that is still too difficult to find or use up here. 
Pinterest - I use sporadically but that is getting spoilt by people using it for textual material. 
Quora - I still haven't worked out how to use and think I probably should. Some interesting people have found me and connected with me there.
Diaspora - keep thinking I ought to join but have held off joining another network for now.

Twitter still has the variety of people and the brevity of the messages makes it easier to follow lots of people &amp; organisations (well over 1,600, currently). I use it as my main news service and to keep an eye on what's happening in my sector as well as to connect with individuals. It is the only one that does what it does. I use it as the address I give strangers. Most of all, I use it because I have met the most wonderful and extraordinary people there, and I have met quite a few of the people with whom I converse there. I suppose Twitter is bound to feel different when the volume of people on it is so much higher than when I first started. FB is very different and I would rather not be there these days.

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[For me, Twitter *is* my online social experience. I don't have a FB account, can't get to grips with G+ in any significant way, haven't looked at Pinterest or Path yet. There's something about the 140 character limit that does it - take away that limitation and I stop reading (G+ for example) because my attention is limited.
I use lists so I don't miss tweets from the relatively small number of people that are really important to me. But generally these are people I know offline. Twitter only gets really special socially when you find people on there that become friends when you meet them offline.
Yes, I use it for work stuff and keeping up with news etc, but I could do this other ways. It's the people thing that matters.
Unlike Janet I don't self-censor much but I do find that people aren't really very interested in the banal tweets :) But I don't care. They can always unfollow me if they like :)]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>The Business</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[How many times do we see social networks struggle along, build user bases and raise endless amounts of venture capital, only to get to the point where they have to come up with a business model that will keep them going for the long term?

Twitter is a great example. Even now it is scrabbling around trying to find revenue opportunities to make it viable. And what do we get, as users? We get half-baked advertweets inserted in our timelines. We get to suffer the output of some lowly marketing executive's imagination bypass. 

And it's not just Twitter. All the platforms are at it. Little boxes selling unwanted crap on Facebook, tedious promotional overlays on YouTube videos. It's tacked-on-at-the-last-minute inconvenience, a "monstrous carbuncle on a much-loved friend", to quote some guy who's been passed over for promotion.

But it doesn't have to be like this. Advertising doesn't have to be an afterthought, a last ditch attempt to salvage the solvency of a bunch of amateurs that got lucky and made something popular when they were just trying to make an online shopping list or hipster photo album.

What if, just if, we could put advertising at the heart of it? Instead of scrabbling around for the next social networking money pit we stopped for a second and thought about how much we all loved advertising. Truly. We can't get enough of it.

We stop in the middle of films because we want to know more about toothpaste. We stop reading tedious articles about science to look at beautiful flashing graphics of anti-virus software. We're obsessed. And the only thing getting in the way of all this glory is our friends trying to have conversations with us. Or people trying to write informative stuff that nobody cares about, like the environment. Or health.

So, here's the opportunity. Instead of trying to shoehorn advertising into the next big thing, why don't we just make advertising the next big thing? Why not build a network of advertising? We could have websites with advertising that filled the whole page instead of being relegated to the side, or sheepishly inserted into articles.

We could have apps that laugh in the face of tiny adverts at the bottom of the screen. They could fill the screen. They would be the apps. And there would be no apologetic business model. There would be no scrabbling around for money. This would be all about money.

So, twenty-something men (because you will be men and you will be twenty-something), next time you want to make something truly awesome, think about this. Start with a plan. Make an advertising network that everyone can be part of. Give us what we really want. And if some years down the line your investors make you tack on features like "sharing" or "liking" then that's fine. Because you'll be making money. And so you'll have already won the internet.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Communication Inertia</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've always been fascinated by how an established communication medium is viewed as more natural and authentic than an emerging one. My reluctance to speak on the phone and preference for email doesn't make me anti-social. Typing is no less natural than speaking into an electronic device. 

Anything that isn't face-to-face is artificial. Humans are designed to be with each other when we communicate. We evolved that way. Everything else is harder, with more room for misunderstanding, is less fulfilling and, ultimately less enjoyable.

So, when I was discussing handwriting and, by extension, the written word, on Twitter earlier it made me think about this all over again. 

Many of the core values of Western society are related to the single biggest revolution in communication, the Gutenberg Press. It democratised access to knowledge and helped the spread of ideas, while at the same time ensuring that we had a legacy, a store of (almost) everything we'd achieved. 

So, it's understandable that a future without the written word is hard to picture. It's in our blood.

The Internet is the single biggest revolution in communication since that Press. And yet we seem to be stuck in limbo. We've built an incredibly sophisticated, peer-to-peer communication network and we still have to write. The written word has a lot going for it but it's also pretty inefficient. You only have to look at the intuitive beauty of the iPad and then try and type on it to see what I mean. 

What does a future without the written word look like? I don't really know. But there are so many different ways to communicate, share knowledge and enjoy the richness of human interaction that I think it's worth thinking about. I'd have found it much easier to video this but I didn't. What's holding us back?]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Serendipity Architecture</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The video call is the biggest threat to humanity we've ever faced. The video call is the final nail in the coffin of talking to the person next to us. The path of anti-social behaviour books started us on will lead to the edge of a massive cliff by way of the video call.

Technology has an uncanny knack for doing two completely opposite things at the same time: bringing us together and pulling us apart. Books connect us with humanity and isolate us from the here and now. Telephones allow us to speak to people we care about while ignoring our neighbours. Smartphones, well, we know about those.

The thing is, it gets worse at every stage. At least books offer a quiet indulgence. At least home telephones only make us a pest to our own families. Mobile phones make us everyone's shouty neighbour. So, imagine the video phone in full, global use. Picture it. See us all with headphones on, rambling at our screens. I love video calls to my family when I'm away, but what if the video call became so embedded that we used it all the time?

All of this is a reminder that most of us are in the wrong place most of the time. The more we're not in the right place the more we need to use technology to connect us to others who are similarly displaced. But what if we were rarely in the wrong place? What if technology helped us to be in the right place more often? I don't mean that we travel to see people all the time, but that we were in the right place to start with.

I'm fascinated by Serendipity Architecture, like Twitter translated to the physical world. Where Twitter allows us to communicate with anyone (according to some unspoken hierarchy of perceived importance) Serendipity Architecture adds a geographical layer. Really want to meet someone? Did you know that they were going to be stopping in York for half an hour on their way to a conference in two weeks' time? You'll be only ten minutes away on that day. See if they'd like a quick chat.

Or, more to the point, see if your destinies are written in the algorithms. Because it will all come down to mathematics. Social technologies have an opportunity to solve one of of the biggest problems we face - constantly being in the wrong place. But the mechanics behind it are incredible. Yes, there are apps already starting to build something future-facing, but they're largely limited to friends and still pretty basic.

The truly exciting apps of the future will take Serendipity Architecture to a global stage. They will enable us to meet anyone based on where we happen to be at a particular time and who we're interested in meeting (and another layer which, hopefully, is not derived from our Klout scores). On a more practical level they will drastically reduce our need to travel. But, most importantly, they will save us from a future of video calls.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Content Marketing is the New Junk Mail</title>
  <link>https://mistergough.wordpress.com/2012/06/13/content-marketing-is-the-new-junk-mail/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This may be unpopular.

Everyone seems to be talking about Content Marketing and Inbound Marketing, the central ideas of which seem to be littering the world's servers with potentially useful information (like blog posts) in the hope that the trail of digital breadcrumbs leads people back to the author's widget business.

The rationale of this approach seems to be strongly aligned with a particular view of social media as an opportunity to demonstrate how brilliant we all are without bluntly stating that we're all brilliant. I suppose it's more "media" than "social".

Content Marketing is seen as a move away from the mythical days of advertising which was apparently designed to ram nothing but "buy my stuff" down people's throats (a view of advertising I happen to disagree with). Now we've made it to "I'm clever. Buy my stuff", which may or may not be viewed as progress.

The problem with Content Marketing is exactly the same as the problem with Junk Mail. It has the potential to litter the world with lots and lots of stuff that has no relevance to most people. The easier it gets to produce content the easier it gets to clog up the internet with it.

So, which of the million articles about the basics of using Pinterest should I read? The more there are, the more I'm likely to decide none of them. Which is a shame, because I rather like Pinterest. The daunting task of trawling through everything that's been written is far more time-consuming than working it out for myself.

I always understood good marketing to be about problem-solving. Content Marketing doesn't seem to be about that. Content Marketing seems to be about cracking a nut with a sledgehammer. And now we're all tripping over sledgehammers. Content Marketing seems to go against the person-to-person foundations of the social web. It's another broadcast platform, when we have the tools for something much better.

So, for me the most dangerous thing about Content Marketing is the name, Content Marketing. It makes the whole purpose a constant drive to produce content, when the real purpose of marketing should be to reach out to people, help them, give them things of value, create experiences and, yes, encourage them to buy your stuff. We all need good content but identifying and serving individual needs should be paramount. I think we should invest our efforts in that. What do you think?]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am just waiting for the day when the earch engines decide that too much content marketing is considered a penalty if the content is traceable back to the site it is marketing to. This is in the same vein as to why Pinterest worries me. Not the concept, but the execution. Pinterest is a wonderful idea that will most likely be ruined by SEOs and other people in the marketing community. It is a link farm waiting to happen because Internet marketers tend to beat any good idea into the ground.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Content Marketing is dangerous whenever it results in an emphasis on volume and frequency over quality and relevance. Smart people in the content strategy community - allied to CM, but different - are increasingly showing how counter-productive that approach is. You are actually likely to see better conversion from reducing the volume of content you publish. It's your Pinterest point: customers can find the relevant stuff faster when there's less of it. But this also requires companies to invest resources in creating good quality content, ideally hiring copywriters and editors to create it for them.  This inevitably falls victim to 'snake oil' content marketers selling the easier, cheaper formula of low-quality volume content.

Jeff's right that a lot of this is driven by SEO and the mantra that more content, more often is they way to keep Google happy. Ranking higher on Google is such a hot button for business - understandably - that it's difficult to argue for a "less is more" approach. Reading between the lines of recent Google announcements, it seems they are moving in the direction of valuing quality over volume: hence moves to penalise content farms etc... Remains to be seen how that actually works out in practice. Would be great to see some small biz sites with a limited amount of great content beat the content whores.

Of course, this is all pointing a finger at content marketing done badly. Done well, with proper resources, content marketing creates a 'just right' amount of quality content, backed up by great customer engagement through social channels. Unfortunately that's a lot harder and more time intensive than blasting out another "Top Ten..." link bait post.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think your last point is exactly where Simon hit the nail on the head. It's the use of "Marketing" that has led some bad marketers to think it's all about hitting people with a veritable blast pattern of less-than-good content no one will ever read or care about. I think the biggest problem in all of it is that people care too much about the search engines (and I think this is partly the search engines fault) and less about the people they are marketing to, which has never been a sustainable model and a waste of resources. 

Maybe a name change would help, maybe it wouldn't. It would be nice if this could be corrected before it simply becomes another penalty in the eyes of Google and the other search engines.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[A good article but I wonder if it doesn't take into consideration that the Internet is for everyone, whether they are content dumpers or not or whether they have commercial objectives which brings in the likes of SEO etc. But what I do get from the post is the fact that we are even more inundated with crap on the web. The recent Penguin update by Google was one step in assuring that such things didn't happen and that Googles service of providing relevant quality information was trying to content with the issue. Perhaps this is dawn of a new search theory such as subject specific search engines that can measure better quality content based on certain merits and values. What they are I don't know but we do know that content is king, and what might not be valuable to you may be valuable to someone else, and this means that we may never find a solution to the problem you describe.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for all the comments. I do agree that there are so many ways to abuse content marketing and that, yes, done right, good content is a worthwhile investment. And, of course, people are also free to use the web in whichever way they choose. But there's a bit of a Prisoner's Dilemma problem here. Ultimately, if we continue to focus on generating content as a strategy, there will continue to be a race to produce as much content as possible. This will ultimately prove to be an expensive and completely futile path as the web gets to a saturation point that benefits neither customers not marketers.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm pretty sure we passed the content saturation point some time ago - certainly if the quality of the stuff posted to LinkedIn Groups is anything to go by. In truth we are all mad for publishing. From tweets and status updates to cute cat videos, to companies creating complex content marketing campaigns, we are creating vastly more content than can ever be meaningfully consumed. Lazy, uninspiring, strategy-free content marketing exacerbates that, but it's not the root cause nor sole culprit. In truth, it's the very nature of the web that it has never been easier to create and share content. This is both wonderous and terrifying in equal measure.

I'm not sure content marketing is actually the problem. I think the problem is the lazy way many companies adopt any new Big Thing in online marketing, which whatever breed of 'guru' is fashionable this year have sold them as the easy answer to their marketing problems. "All you need is a blog/Facebook page/Twitter profile/Pinterest account/more content." As this is usually a way to avoid the hard work of developing strategy, they also avoid the hard work elements of the Big Thing and go for the easy, lazy, thought-free approaches. So content marketing is reduced to a matter of generating volume, just as  social media strategy is reduced to chasing follower numbers. This doesn't mean either content or social media marketing are worthless. It's just that lots of people do them badly because they don't get it.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Randomness and Value</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Let's just imagine for a moment that organisations have no idea what they're doing. And, by way of balance, let's pretend that people have no idea what they want. Picture a world in which pretty much everyone is clueless, in which every next step is just guessed at and people choose things on a whim.

The last time you talked to someone about what they wanted to do with their lives how did the conversation go? Were they absolutely clear? Were there doubts? And how sure were they really? If another idea came along, a new job or an offer to move to another country, would they stick to their original plan?

If people are like this with their life plans, what does this mean for the day-to-day? Are they going to be loyal to brands? Do they know which cleaning products are best? Are they absolutely sure about their favourite place to go on holiday? Do they know what public services they really need?

Our decisions are a function of what we already know, what we can easily find out, our moods and whatever else happens when it comes to the crunch. Which is another way of saying that it's essentially random. And organisations are just made up of lots of people, so how can we expect them to be any different?

Of course we don't really talk about what organisations want. We talk about strategy. So, bringing us back to the beginning of the post, let's just imagine that those strategies are completely made up, by groups of people with no clear idea of what they want.

What this means is that organisations and people can't properly interact by way of transactions. Real transactions are heavily reliant on clear articulation and mutual agreement. In our random world that's possible on a shallow, micro-level but it just can't scale. And the mistake organisations make is that they think a minor transaction is a connection with their values.

Real connections come from something else altogether. When organisations don't know what to do and people don't know what they want, connections come from mutual support. People need organisations to help them make better choices as much as organisations need people to show them the way forward.

This mutual support through the gauntlet of indecision and randomness is a powerful thing, easily abused but easily spotted. Just because nobody knows what they want it doesn't mean that nobody is going to notice when they haven't got it.

And so, the important thing is to embrace and be honest about how little we have a clue. And how much we all need each other to create anything of real value. After all, everything is much more exciting that way. Let's all stop pretending and get on with it.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In looking at many local charities, and perhaps even considering our own, I do have a sense that many of these organisations start with a vision or at least a sense of purpose and an idea of how they are going to do it. With a little bit of foothold they go through a phase of testing and trying all sorts of things that may help them get where they want to be, do what they want to do. And then finally work out what and how it works and what it means to others - both donors/funders and clients/beneficaries. In short, they work out what it is they have created.

I'm not sure I would call this random - there are a lot of variables involved, particularly in the middle phases-  but that makes it complex, maybe chaotic, but not necessairly random. 

The influence of directed, restricted by generously funded programmes from public sector and large trusts can often interfere with this (mission drift?) but just as I usually instinctively like tracks that were recorded live in the studio, the charities I admire the most tend to be those that remain relatively free of externally-driven programmes, have their own inner strength of purpose and have been through this journey of]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment, Justin. I appreciate that random might be putting it strongly but I'm also conscious that we place far too much emphasis on strategies and being seen to know what to do. In my opinion, this need to clarify direction can stifle some of the more responsive and innovative approaches.

The challenge for charities is an interesting one. Much of what I see from charities is very clearly designed to articulate that they need a certain amount of money to do something specific about a problem. However, most of us know that what is really needed is usually far more complex than simple transactions and fixes.

The challenge for all organisations I think is to find new ways to be more honest about the complexity of their work and new ways to take their audience on the journey with them. Organisations that have had that strong relationship and learnt as well as educated have a real opportunity to demonstrate honesty and integrity. I like the idea of this relationship helping to reinforce that "inner strength of prupose".]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[We do a lot of projects in our work. That means we also look at a lot of other people's projects. One of the effects of that is a constant paranoia that things are too similar. Either we're doing a project that's like one we already do or just like someone else's. 

It's different from doing things for clients. Work for clients always starts from a unique position. It's all about them. In contrast, everything we do for ourselves comes from us and, let's face it, we don't change that much from one moment to the next. 

Conventional wisdom demands that we  strategically position projects or products to differentiate them. Traditional marketing speak has left the world with a miserable legacy of USP's and competitive differentiators. It's why we have toothbrushes with tongue-scrapers rather than just really good toothbrushes. 

In the real world things are rarely unique. Most things are a bit like other things. Actively fighting that delivers short-lived ideas with novelty value that do nothing but say they're different. Most of the products and services we encounter on a daily basis have been derived from this artificial attempt to be unique.

So, if we listened to this paranoia when we develop projects we'd be constantly be looking for Project+, the project with something a bit special added. The thing is, we know from experience that this would fail.

Truly differentiated projects and ideas come from constant attention, not being afraid to adapt, working with different people, as much time as can be afforded and a real desire to do something useful. In other words lots and lots of honest, thoughtful iterations. 

Trying to fake this natural process creates shallow ideas and short-lived initiatives. Knowing this gives us the freedom to step back and have faith in the process. It's a bit like gardening. And no two gardens are the same.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Cost of Sale</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday I bought two ice creams for my daughters. They were £1.75 each. Not hugely expensive for ice cream. But the scoops were rather on the stingy side. And the people serving weren't very friendly. Or efficient. Factored together, it wasn't the most enjoyable £3.50 I've ever spent.

My girls enjoyed their ice creams. But they don't buy them, so they're not going to feature in the rest of this post, which is most certainly about buying ice creams. 

When I left the cafe I was thinking about how easy it would have been to make me happy. Perhaps the ice creams could have been £1.50. Maybe the scoops could have been remarkably big. Maybe with free sprinkles and a smile. Nothing too heavy. No need to employ a consultant. 

I always imagine that the thinking behind most cafes is the same. "How can we charge as much as possible for the minimum?" This is an easy strategy. Work out how much people are willing to pay and how little ice cream they'll find acceptable. Assuming the cost of the scoop in this case was about 10p, then this isn't a bad margin.

But as I was walking away I was thinking of all the people I'd have told if the ice cream had been exceptional. The last exceptional ice cream I had was about six years ago and I still remember it. Sadly it was in Italy. But if it had been in Somerset I'd still be sending people to get one now.

So I could have told lots of people if the ice creams we bought yesterday were amazing. And all those people could have told their friends. Which raises an interesting point.

Good businesses know that word of mouth is important. If I do something well other people will get to know about it. But it's a fairly intangible concept. How many people will get to know? Businesses like the cafe I went to probably don't grasp the reality of this idea and I don't blame them. They have to think about the numbers, deriving the most profit from each individual transaction. 

So I was thinking about a more effective way to translate the word of mouth idea into numbers.

Let's assume that we're all connected. That between face-to-face friendships, telephones, the pub, the school run, Facebook, Twitter and everything else we know everyone in the world. 104,100 of those people live within a few miles of that cafe. It wouldn't be asking much to imagine each one of those people buying one exceptional ice cream a year.

The area around the cafe also attracts about 3 million visitors a year. Again, I don't think it would be asking too much for 10% of those people to go and buy an exceptional ice cream each. So that's another 300,000 ice creams. 

All in all, with the right product, our little cafe could be selling 404,100 ice creams a year. I estimate that they're probably selling closer to 10,000. In other words they're missing out on about 394,100 ice cream sales by being a bit crap. 

If they adjusted their pricing (lower) and product (better) a bit they might manage £1 mark up on each ice cream. Adding all this together their approach to ice cream sales is costing them about £394,100 a year.

Of  course, they did make about £3.30 on the two ice creams they sold me. And that's money in the till. But £394,100 of money they could have made is never going in the till. That's a very expensive product.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Unfortunately, I think too many cafés don't understand that they could be a lot more successful for little more effort. I get exasperated with the poor quality of coffee and ordinary sandwiches. Like ice creams, these are such basic things. There is a café that I love for its architecture and location, and the staff are nice, but the only thing that I will buy there is a cup of tea, occasionally, although they do ice cream sundaes and knickerbocker glories. The best ice cream (in a cone) I ever had was in Beverley in Yorkshire...one day in the mid-1970s.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>A Not Entirely Useful Post About Personal Branding</title>
  <link>https://mistergough.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/a-not-entirely-useful-post-about-personal-branding/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've had a bit of a lapse the last couple of weeks. What with being tired and having to look after my parents away from home I felt a bit disconnected from the more social things I normally do, like talk to people on Twitter (yes, I missed my family too but that isn't what this is about).

At the same time I didn't want to hide away completely. I wanted to stay in touch with people. So I was a bit stuck, because I use Twitter in a particular way, a very personal way. And I wasn't feeling very personable. But I felt a need to keep going.

By way of trying to deal with this I looked at things from another angle. I attempted to work out what I was like on Twitter from an external perspective. I suppose I tried to work out what my style was. Have you ever done that, looked at your own tweets and tried to understand them en masse? 

Suffice to say it's a bit odd. Perhaps if I stuck to a topic it would seem clearer. But I don't. And most people I know don't. So when I look at my tweets they're just little, half-formed thoughts, hanging there. Perhaps there's the occasional link to a worthy article to keep the quality levels up. 

Anyway, after thinking about Twitter for a while, here's what I did.  I tried to fake it. I looked at the general flow of things I tweeted about and tried to recreate that, keep it going. I shared a few links, tweeted about some of the things that were going on (largely observations about hospitals). And, of course, I tried to maintain conversations with my favourite people.

In other words, I suppose I tried to maintain my Personal Brand. Not that I've ever set out to have a Personal Brand. Most people don't. And all good branding people know that brands exist whether or not you want them. The most we can ever do is tinker. This is never more true than when we're talking about people's own brands. 

A brand is a very sophisticated thing, emerging from a complex set of interactions. Everything you do and say is one more part of it. Even in 140 characters our personalities come across. What my slightly disconcerting experiment told me is that it's very difficult to understand your own brand. Of course, it's possible for others to see it but then that perception is only theirs. 

So, after this attempt to keep myself going I have some not entirely useful thoughts on personal branding.

I think you can create less friction between yourself and the rest of the world. I think you can set things up so that your brand is more clearly communicated. I'll even accept that you can reinforce your brand through various means.

But you can't get to the centre of it. You can be yourself but only if you happen to be yourself. It's not a choice. Everything you do that tries to get to the heart of your Personal Brand pushes it a little further away. We're constantly stuck between the difficulty of understanding ourselves and the one-dimensional perceptions of others. 

When I wasn't up to tweeting I should have stayed away. I realise that now. I also wrote some pretty shonky blog posts in the same period. Another symbol of the need to be consistent. This post is no exception. But I wanted to write about my experiences. And now I have, and my parents are getting better, and I've been home a while. So things are getting back to normal. Hopefully I am too. ]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Follower Model is a Broadcast Legacy</title>
  <link>https://mistergough.wordpress.com/2012/07/11/the-follower-model-is-a-broadcast-legacy/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[From what I understand Twitter started out as a simple service to communicate between small groups of closely connected people with SMS integration. Looking it up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter" title="Wikipedia article on Twitter" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> I find this quote:

"Dorsey introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group."

In other words I suppose you could see Twitter as a lightweight, simple version of what Path is now, a platform for small groups to stay in touch. This makes sense. Like Path, this original idea means that in most use cases everyone would have followed everyone else. 

But Twitter grew. And bigger numbers bring different structures. What is manageable in a small group isn't manageable with thousands of people. Ultimately people started to make decisions between following everyone that followed them or only following a small group of people that were of interest. In between those extremes came all sorts of variations, like lists that enabled you to keep up with the really interesting people while pretending to take notice of the rest. 

Essentially what happened is that huge growth reverted Twitter to a broadcast model. For many people it became more about getting a following than having a discussion. So, there's a disconnect at the heart of Twitter. A huge imperfection that makes it sort of useful for self-promoters and sort of useful for conversationalists. But not perfect for either.

Twitter trundles on with these flaws and in many ways is more loved because of them. But the follower model that it operates on looks increasingly like a throwback to broadcast media. Some of the most disillusioned Tweeters cite lack of conversation as one of the key factors in their disillusionment. In other words, the broadcast framework of Twitter is seeing increasingly broadcast behaviour. 

But that's Twitter. And Twitter isn't really the issue here because, as I've said, Twitter is flawed and mostly still loved anyway. What is the issue is when new platforms use the same follower model. Most of the new services I try still seem to think that following people is the best route to social interaction. They immediately adopt a broadcast approach. Which seems a little backward. 

It's a bit like always hearing everything ever said by anyone I've ever met. My Twitter stream is full of people who have said interesting things at some point but who I've never got round to unfollowing. Even though I probably should have done. This will be the same for every other platform I sign up to that has the same model. 

The reality for me is that the follower model makes everything rather stilted. There's an inertia at the heart of the architecture that actively works against social discovery and conversation. Sometimes I feel like I'm reading a very sophisticated newspaper rather than connecting with people on a social platform. Of course, there are exceptions, but they are exceptions. 

So I think that the follower model is too much a legacy of broadcast media to be a useful blueprint for the social future. Social dynamics need to be better understood and hard-wired in to the next wave of social apps. Otherwise the promise of all this social stuff will be squandered.

Don't forget to follow me on Wordpress.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I use Twitter with the default settings, and I like the default settings. Strictly speaking, that is a 'broadcast' model, because it's not like Facebook, where we both have to agree to be friends, but when you call it a 'legacy' it makes it sound like black and white television, or a throwback to an earlier generation of media. I don't think there are any 'read-only' Twitter clients. Everyone with a Twitter account has always had the power to send messages, although not everybody does, and not everybody attracts followers.   

I think Twitter has succeeded because it has hardly anything hard-wired into it.  (As Neil Innes said, it's 'totally not thought through'.) The social dynamics are soft, emergent, negotiated, local, diverse and changeable. It's a space where anybody can have a voice, and nobody has to put up with anybody they don't get on with. That makes it a great tool for trying out new behaviours and new forms of affinity in a world whee everything is abundant except attention.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thoughtful stuff Simon, and I agree. Twitter was the next best iteration of social interaction at the time. It couldn't have really been anything else. 

We can take affinity to the next level so it's more sustainable and dynamic through deeper more generative connections perhaps, multi-layered and levelled content choices, impact models as news.me is beginning to develop. I still think e.g. Ning has a lot going for it in terms of provoking creative communications and play and wouldn't want to throw any babies out with the bathwater in a relentless quest for 'more' or 'better' too soon. 

But these are the kinds of useful observations that help the process of how we benefit from platform maturity, lots to get better, and lots to appreciate too as springboards for the future, based on what we now know as a result of experience.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thank you for raising some important points in this interesting post, Simon. It seems to combine a fairly balanced mix of rant, reason and requirements.

Trying to discern your meaning, it seems that the desire for "social discovery and conversation" is high on the agenda.

Initially, your post triggered me to draft a long diatribe which organised communication channel behaviour into layers which handle: connection, messaging and conversation. This succeeded in proving, to me at least, that whether a "follower" model for managing connections correlates with the use of a channel in "broadcast" mode depends partly on the definition of "broadcast", but mainly on the choice, in the substantial messaging layer that lies between those two areas, of message exchange patterns which are not discussed in your post. So there seems little value in sharing the details of that with everyone. Also, labelling something as "legacy" implies a costly millstone, which broadcasting may not be, especially when we can ignore it and have alternatives; maybe substituting the label "heritage" might reflect its role as a valuable foundation and, even, as a springboard for what comes next.

On your main point, it seems that your objection to the current state of affairs relates primarily to the criteria for selection of the information that is delivered to you by these communication channels. In particular, I wonder whether, instead of the identity of the author or sender dominating the selection, you might prefer that much more weight be given to subject area, quality, location, relevance or something else.

If so, the way forward might lie in wider availability and use of search functionality including, so called, smart searches which stream updates of matching messages as they are found. Maybe this will be the transition from identity-based to content-based discovery, that has been seen for documents on the web, now being applied to messaging.

Keep the ideas and desires coming and let's think about how products might satisfy them!]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I completely agree about Twitter's openness and lack of forethought. It's clear how lost it is as a platform when it tries to bolt on new features. Very few of them seem to be received well by its core users. 

But, while that openness makes Twitter an almost organic platform it's sad to see that developers of new platforms are just trying to implement the same architecture, like the subtler lessons of Twitter's experimentation haven't been learned. 

Thanks for the comment.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[And thank you for commenting here. Deeper conversations are very difficult on Twitter and it would be great to see new platforms emerge that put conversations at the centre rather than following. At the moment it seems back to front.

I agree about the importance of blogging in all this too. I haven't been doing it myself all that long but it's interesting how writing a blog changes your social dynamics.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment. You're right in that it's a learning process and iterative, which is why seeing new platforms that clearly haven't learnt is so sad. But, yes, there are new models on the horizon and that's good. 

Ning is an interesting one. One if its earlier barriers to adoption was the fact that it created separate networks. Many people were saying that it was better to be where the crowd was. But it's almost like it's come full circle. Now people are seeing the value of niche interests to drive more meaningful conversations, and topic-specific platforms will benefit from this.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment. You've hit the nail on the head by suggesting that I'm more interested in the content than the author. This might seem counter-intuitive for a social platform but I actually believe we'd develop better relationships by moving more to a content focus.

You could well be right that the search and discovery tools are an obvious area to work on but it seems like a peripheral fix to a fundamental architecture problem. 

However, as has been said before in these comments, Twitter has provided a good platform for experimentation and is a natural iteration of the broadcast model. But if we know that why do so many new platforms use the same architecture?]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://mistergough.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/parallelstatetweet1.jpg"><img src="http://mistergough.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/parallelstatetweet1.jpg" alt="Tweet Grab" title="Tweet Grab" width="545" height="256" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-248" /></a>

I've thought about politics and economics a lot these past few months. I'm really interested in the mechanics of it all. One of the things I thought about was how much it would take before there was a revolution in this country. I had two conclusions:

1) It will never happen
2) It's undesirable.

With regard to 1, I don't believe that we'll ever hit the point of such clearly felt oppression that people are willing to be imprisoned/die to make a difference. I may be wrong, but actually I hope it doesn't happen, which leads me to explaining point 2.

I'm pretty sure that revolution is the most damaging kind of disruption. There are so many examples of where it has been the only (and necessary) route that we have plenty to learn from. Large-scale disruption is a guaranteed way to plunge everything into chaos for a considerable length of time and I don't think that's the answer to our problems (if you don't think we have problems then this is probably a good point to stop reading).

In a democratic country we only really have two routes to making change: democracy and revolution. We can either go through the democratic process we've fought so hard to build and protect, or we can overthrow the government through other means. If we rule out revolution for practical reasons then we need to focus on the democratic process.

To put it bluntly, the democratic process isn't working. The choices we have are increasingly futile, and fewer and fewer people believe that the government is acting in the best interests of the citizens. Given the current state of the opposition and the suicide of a third political party we're also highly likely to maintain the current government at the next election.

The alternative parties we have are often single-issue extremists. While they may make gains in certain areas, around key topics, they never seem likely to be viable as a full government. In part this is because they fragment opinion, but it's also because they don't demonstrate a capability of handling all the functions of the State.

I believe this leaves us in a difficult, but not escapable position.

There is an unprecedented opportunity to build something better. And at the heart of it is a very simple idea. Instead of creating a political party that enters the next general election on the promise of making things better, let's demonstrate how things can be made better first. Use all the ideas, enthusiasm, and practical experience to re-invent the functions of the state, from health and education to banking, as if people mattered.

We have the knowledge and technologies to build things from the ground up, create all the functions of the State and big business in parallel, demonstrate new approaches to strong communities. And, most importantly, pull this together through the vehicle of a crowd-funded political party. In other words, we could go for the big target. OK, it's a bit ambitious. But there's more out there to draw on than ever before. And we have the means to connect it all up. In other words, this is practical.

There's a lot more to this than I want to write here. I wanted to keep this post as short as possible. There's a lot more to be said about what a political party formed on social principles might look like. There's a lot more to be said about what properly designing the State around its citizens might look like. There's a lot more to be said around network dynamics and democracy. But I think we should revisit that later.

For now, I want there to be a clear next step. There will most likely be a get-together of some sort at the end of November to get some perspectives on the idea. In the meantime the easiest way to communicate is probably a Twitter account. So, if you want to stay connected then please follow <a href="https://twitter.com/citizenstate" title="Citizen State" target="_blank">@citizenstate</a> on Twitter. And, of course, please share.

Thanks.

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I have a question, and it might come across as challenging: are we hoping to build your model of what you think things should look like, or are you aiming to form a consensus? The root of the democratic problem, if you like, is that not everyone can get their way all the time and so we end up with the institutions we collectively deserve.  Our major political parties are all democratic in some form or another. Why wouldn't we join one of those parties instead?

Or, quite possibly, I'm completely missing the point.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In my opinion, one of the biggest reasons we're in the mess we're in now is precisely the fact that people confuse leadership with having the answers. The constant need to demonstrate that we are right about everything is a curse on meaningful discourse and, by extension, the democratic process.

My starting point here is to say that I know things can be done better if only we do more than complain about everything. Let's use the opportunities and ideas around us to pull something useful together. Yes, there are small changes everywhere but small changes and battles won are sometimes the biggest dangers. New projects, changes in thinking and small wins give us hope. They make us think that change is happening. But this isn't usually how it works. Somewhere out there are plenty of people who don't want change, and they have the means to stop it.

If you want to make real, long-lasting change you need to go after the big targets. You need to do something ambitious that completely circumvents the system we have. I've outlined very briefly how that might be done. But the mechanics of doing it need many more people to get involved and, at the very least, try. I'm not suggesting that I want to be the leader of anything here, it's the opposite of what I want. I'd just like to see what it might mean to create a party for people in the networked age. 

Thank you for the comment.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment. To answer your question I'm looking to do both, and neither. By writing this post in the first place I'm trying to get across that I have something in mind, albeit a vague notion of something better. And I'm also suggesting that the most important thing to do right now is gather together a group of people with some degree of consensus on moving forward.

However, it would be wrong of me to suggest that I have a vision I want people to sign up to, or indeed that I'm hoping to form a movement with a single, shared purpose. If we feel the need to do either of those things then I think we're still looking at things from the perspective of our own democratic legacy, and that is the thing I really think we need to change.

I have three things in mind at this point:

1) That the current State is very, very broken
2) That I'm not the only person that thinks this
3) That we have the means to do something about it

With reference to 3, the possibility of redesigning the functions of the State around people is very real, and the network to pull all the people together exists. My starting point is to say that something ambitious can be done; the people who care enough to make it happen are out there; and, most importantly, I don't want to be sat here ten years from now still talking about it.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Interesting you mention that parties should "demonstrate how" they would make things better. I agree. However, you appear to not do the same. Instead you talk the rhetoric of the need for change, which we all know and fully appreciate, and yet do not provide even the smallest example of how. Perhaps because what you might suggest is already happening, and you just don't recognise it. Change is challenging. Slow change is lasting embedded change. Let's not be hares lets be tortoises. Slow and steady wins the race...]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>The Gini Coefficient and the Offshore First World</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[When I was "a bit" younger I spent some time studying development economics. One of the most fascinating things I learned about was something called the Gini Coefficient. The Gini Coefficent, when applied to income structures, describes the relative inequality of incomes in an economy.

One of the interesting things about this is that the income inequality isn't just an accident of a small group of people having too much money but is in fact structurally desirable for those people. In development economics we learned how less developed countries with high Gini Coefficients (poorly distributed incomes) are very useful for more developed countries.

In simple terms the poorer the general population of a country the less able they are to create the infrastructure for developing their own wealth. And so, some countries become the cheap manual labour for other countries. At the same time people in those exploited countries want to own the same things that people in more equal income countries own. So exports for the "first world" countries are good too. Finally, countries with small groups of exceedingly rich people are great for exports of our luxury goods.

All in all it's a win win for the more developed world.

So, when we see increasingly high Gini Coefficients in our own, richer country, it makes me wonder. After all, we're the ones who are supposed to be exploiting everyone else. But this is missing the point. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18944097" title="Tax avoidance article" target="_blank">This article</a>, about the $21tn currently being hidden in offshore accounts makes something very clear. At some point in recent history EVERY country became part of the less developed world. People who benefit from high Gini Coefficients don't really live in a country at all anymore. And they're not looking for things to change any time soon.]]></content:encoded>

The various components of tourism provide some of Service Design's most engaging challenges. From the logistical complexities of transport to the experiential intricacies of accommodation, tourism is a rich seam of opportunity for people in the business of creating and managing service experiences.

<a href="http://www.redfront.co.uk/index.php/site/article/sdt2012/" title="Redfront at SDT2012" target="_blank">Our visit</a> to <a href="http://www.servicedesigntourism.com/conference/" title="SDT2012" target="_blank">SDT2012</a> in Innsbruck provided ample opportunity to consider the past, present and future of tourism as a service, and as one of the greatest experiences we can have. From the timeless beauty of Innsbruck and its mountain setting, to the tourism innovation laid out in the sessions, the possibilities for tourism are endless.

Data was an unavoidable theme of the conference. While the explosion in tourism-relevant data types is unlocking real potential for new experiences and delivery mechanisms it's clear that we're only at the beginning of a journey that will generate completely new models of user-experience. The challenge for Service Design is to find new ways to pull together wildly different types of data, from sentiment to climate, and turn them into something individually meaningful.

The evening before the conference <a href="https://twitter.com/netsaver" title="Thomas Schonweitz" target="_blank">Thomas Schönweitz</a> was talking about how designers wanted to make the world better. I kept revisiting this idea as the interconnectedness of tourism with the environment and corporate responsibility wove in and out of the conference tracks. Tourism needs to go beyond the mitigation of impact and consider new possibilities for positive intervention. User-experience is increasingly inseparable from global implications.

The first day opened with <a href="https://twitter.com/DaveCarroll" title="Dave Carroll" target="_blank">Dave Carroll</a>, whose customer experience with United Airlines became something of an internet meme. His <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo&amp;list=UUXV4alUKwDP9BYTEel1ftww&amp;index=0&amp;feature=plcp" title="United Breaks Guitars" target="_blank">music video</a>, based on the damage his guitar suffered at United's hands, has now been seen by nearly 13 million viewers. A stark reminder of how wrong a service can go and a useful start to two days of thinking about the user.

Other keynotes explored the history of Service Design in tourism, with <a href="https://twitter.com/kipum" title="Kip Lee" target="_blank">Kip Lee</a> talking about great examples like César Ritz; or some of the contemporary challenges of Service Design, as <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/barney-kirby/1/133/832" title="Barney Kirby" target="_blank">Barney Kirby</a> took us through the mind-boggling scale and complexity of delivering integrated digital services for Marriott hotels.

From the introductions onwards there were constant reminders of the topic's sheer diversity. Contributors talked about everything from sensory studies in theme parks to wayfinding in airports. Some of it was mid-study, some of it had failed, but all of it was open to discussion. It was good to see some real honesty.

One of the core ideas of the conference was meeting people, and in keeping with this social approach the first day ended in a communal dinner upstairs at MCI, overlooking Innsbruck and the mountains beyond. Despite the heat of the evening (designers need to work on this) the combination of food, talk and game-playing punctuated the conference neatly.

The second day packed in more talks but it's worth a special mention for the workshops. The whole conference combined presentations and workshops in parallel tracks and although I did miss some of the more interactive sessions on the first day I was lucky enough to make it to <a href="http://workplayexperience.com/en" title="Work Play Experience" target="_blank">Adam and Markus</a>' hour of serious play on day two.

Adam and Markus stepped in again the following morning to provide a Service Jam and it was fun to spend some time with the conference stragglers, thinking about making things. We had to leave early but the teams struggled on valiantly and the resulting four ideas can be found <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/295631423863636" title="Service jams" target="_blank">here</a>.

My main takeaway from the conference was a feeling that there is a lot of work to be done, that much of the topic is still raw. But the sheer variety of content and approach (from academic insights to service theatrics), coming together under a single theme, shows a willingness and drive to find new connections and innovate. And besides, raw is good.

I hope <a href="https://twitter.com/mrstickdorn" title="Marc Stickdorn" target="_blank">Marc Stickdorn</a> and his team can find the energy to do it all over again next year. I'd like to see more making stuff but then that's what we're into.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi, thanks for your comment. Many of the talks were about case studies and so, although they were generally delivered by researchers or designers, they did cover many different small businesses and events. The programme (http://www.servicedesigntourism.com/conference/?site=programm) has a few case studies that you can click through to although we missed a few of them because we were presenting ourselves. :)

Some of the videos and images are also online now so you can start to see some of the talks. Hope this helps.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>3D Printing and the End of Products</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://mistergough.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/replicator.jpeg"><img src="http://mistergough.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/replicator.jpeg" alt="replicator" title="replicator" width="545" height="363" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-290" /></a>

I've written before about emerging ideas being more about the end of something than the beginning. In <a href="http://mistergough.wordpress.com/2012/02/23/the-collaborative-consumption-myth/" title="The Collaborative Consumption Myth" target="_blank">this post</a> I talked about most models of collaborative consumption being natural evolutions of business efficiency. Instead of collaborative consumption being a new paradigm in ownership many examples are just web technologies squeezing more value from existing industries.

3D printing could be seen in a similar light. We've seen product manufacture go from artisan craftsmanship, through the mass-production of the industrial revolution, to the ultimate efficiency of global division of labour. And in seeing that narrative arc it's hard not to question whether 3D printing is in fact just the endpoint of a more familiar journey.

Supply chain is now the last obstacle for radical cost reduction. When you've found the cheapest places in the world to make your components the real fly in the ointment becomes the cost of moving everything around. And this is where 3D printing enters the fray. When everything can be produced in your own home and the only logistics considerations relate to digital files we reach the nirvana of no friction distribution.

So, surely this is a good thing? In many ways it is. The democratisation of production brings all sort of potential benefits. But there is another way of looking at it. One clear side-effect of centuries of efficiency gains is the decreasing value of objects themselves. Every commodity, from cars to food has become more disposable.

And 3D printing could usher in the ultimate era of disposable products. If anyone could produce anything what would the value of any of it be? More importantly, when we reach that point what will happen next?

If we see 3D printing as the end of something rather than the beginning then perhaps we can imagine moving on to something else. Perhaps this crunch point will allow us to finally complete the transition from objects to experiences and start to develop new models that circumvent product ownership entirely. This, along with properly evolved models of collaborative consumption (in the services market) might take us into a more sustainable future. As long as we can deal with the landfill on the way there.]]></content:encoded>

We're currently doing two projects with a lot of similarities. Both involve using the web to get information into the hands of people who can do something useful with it. Both involve pulling together people, resources and expertise to deliver a genuinely useful service. 

And yet, at the same time, the two projects couldn't be more different. The organisations involved, the overall aims and the experiences we're trying to create, call for very different approaches. 

I've always envied those diagrams and descriptions that companies put on their websites, the ones that show, in clear steps, how they approach and deliver their projects. It makes me feel like I'd know exactly what to expect, what I was getting. It ticks the marketing boxes, clearly articulates the proposition. 

And so, on occasion, I've gone away to write these things myself. I've thought about the stages of a project and the route we'd take with a new client. But nothing ever comes of it. Or at least it's so general ("we talk about it and then we do it") that it serves no purpose. I can list all sorts of principles and tools but never a process.

And so, thinking about those two current projects, it seems that perhaps we don't have a process at all. Or at least all I can say is that we start with talking about the project and something comes out at the end. In between the two is a mixture of what we know works and what new things we can try out.

What I've realised is that you can waste a lot of time trying to fit what you do into boxes. The neatly packaged product, the clearly articulated proposition, something obvious to sell. Straplines. Diagrams. Statements.

I'm not saying that these things don't have their place, but how many people are trying to shoehorn their work into other people's shoes? How many people are trying to summarise what they do to make it snappy? Most importantly, how many people are stripping away subtle complexity for the sake of communication? 

The longer you've been doing your own thing the more you realise that the solution is more complex and simpler at the same time. 

It's complex because trying to think about it all, the marketing messages, the different perceptions, the relationships you have with people in business and the different routes you could take to achieve things, is beyond comprehension.

And it's simple, very simple, because all you have to do is keep going, keep learning, keep talking to people. You have to care enough to want to start from scratch every time. Look at everything like it's the first time you've ever seen it.

And then, hopefully, it's not a conveyor belt, it's a journey.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[What 'process' and 'pigeon holes' miss is empathy - the ability for individuals within an organisation to connect with other individuals inside or outside the organisation on a level that is respectful, thoughtful, and creates comfort and non-comfort zones that ones talent can shine in. Being told or forced to work in another persons language, zone, style, time will never draw the results you want, positive results that can be built on.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment, Stephen. I completely agree about the empathy element but, in reality, so few tools and platforms understand and encourage it. I think there's still a disconnect between the soundbite requirements of the channels we use and the deeper storytelling we need to build more meaningful relationships.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[One of the most important questions we can ask is: "what is this like?"  It's a question that isn't confined to pigeonholes. If every experience was completely new, we'd never learn anything  But we can find similarities without seeing everything as an instance of a type.  Gregory Bateson called it "looking for the difference that makes a difference". Doctors do it when they diagnose symptoms ("What else could cause a pain just there?") Taxi drivers do it when they drive an unfamiliar journey. It would be funny if a taxi driver started every journey by taking the first left and then the second right, or if they said to the passenger, "right, guv, it's  three roundabouts for a tenner, so which ones do you want?"

Everything is new, in some ways, but a repeat in others. If we have a "process" it's more like having a repertoire of stored routines, and knowing  how to decide which ones to use and when.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Don’t be so hard on yourself; “We Talk About It &amp; Then We Do It” would make an excellent strapline! 

Oddly I stumbled upon a post following a very similar theme yesterday, written by Micheal Beirut in 2006 (http://observatory.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=4717). 

He writes about creating proposals where his process is decribed as “…divided in[to] four phases: Orientation and Analysis, Conceptual Design, Design Development, and Implementation.” When the truth is “Somewhere along the way an idea for the design pops into my head from out of the blue. I can’t really explain that part; it’s like magic. Sometimes it even happens before you have a chance to tell me that much about your problem!”.

To me design can sometimes feel like navigating a familiar room in the dark. You know where you started, you know where you want to end up and you know from experience how everything fits together. The rest is simply a case of moving carefully in the right direction until you get there.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Andrew describes very well the way in which ideas show up at any time despite a process, but that does not mean that there are no processes which facilitate or stimulate that. See, for example, Betty Edwards' book "Drawing on the artist within", which is about the process of creativity.
Gordon captures the essence of understanding a subject domain by categorisation, through identifying similarities and patterns, and his description of stored routines applies this to processes.
Isn't much of this about the distinction between analysis and synthesis? It is less of a "break down" and more of a "put together".
Since designing is a holistic (right sided) [see Betty Edwards' first book "Drawing on the right side of the brain"], it is not feasible to start at the top or the bottom or the front or the back of the final result and to progress through to the other end in one pass. This is association, not rugby, football; there is no "gain line".
Isn't it important to think outside the boxes, shoes and holes?
Surely designing involves starting with what we know and have, however discontiguous it all is, and finding arrangements, links, patterns, and new elements which allow partial, and eventually, whole candidate results to be synthesised and selected? Our understanding and choice of dependencies, real or imaginary, especially their direction, is crucial to maintaining focus and flexibility.
We are what we repeatedly do. Processes exist at the day-to-day operational level; and the larger, more complex and important our projects are, the more value there is in capturing, understanding and communicating those operations as repeatable tactics. However we hamper this process if we confuse it with our strategic approach to the current objective and the flexible selection of tactics for its operational implementation.
And we hamper all of this, if we prejudge its nature. There is such a thing as nature, which exists and operates whether we intervene or not!]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Up until the age of eighteen, at which point I discovered that nobody was going to fund it, I wanted to be an architect. I can remember why. I thought architects were cool, stylish and they generally earned lots of money. I wanted it for all the right teenage reasons.

Looking back I still wish I'd been an architect. But for different reasons. I love design. I think the idea of creating spaces for people that shape their lives is amazing. Of course I'm also aware that a lot of architects have pretty miserable, repetitive jobs (I have no evidence to back this up). I'd probably have been one of those architects.

Which brings me to blogging. I wonder sometimes if some of the reasons for blogging are as misguided as some of the less noble visions of being an architect.

If I was honest I'd say that there's a real sense of satisfaction in getting an idea down on 'paper'. There's an enjoyment in people responding to that idea. There's a joy in people sharing the idea. And, of course (now we're all content marketers) it's great to look at the stats. A regular blog can do wonders for your visibility. Unfortunately I was never a regular blogger. Apparently some of my posts were too long as well (this one will fit into that category). There's an optimum for these things.

I actually don't think I blogged for cynical reasons at all. People liking what you've done is always nice, but then I genuinely like writing. I'm not happy with how I write but the process can be enjoyable.

The problem for me is that it's not enough. The self-satisfaction, the connections with people, the visibility. They're all nice-to-haves. But like the less noble features of being an architect, they don't really change people's lives. Good architects do that. Spaces change people's lives.

I'm not comparing the sideline/hobby/passion (for most) of blogging with the full-time career of architecture. But increasingly, for me, blogging is neither one thing nor another. It's a poor way to have a discussion and an even poorer way to make a difference.

And that, hopefully, brings us neatly back to the architecture theme. Architecture is important. I've been meaning to write a more general post about architecture for a while. But the irony of what I wanted to write became so obvious that I needed to end my short-lived blogging career at the same time (this is my last post).

The web makes it easy to throw things together. In about half a day, or less, you can have an idea, plan it out a bit, and throw up a website. Most of those websites will be built upon something like Wordpress. Increasingly they will have other social features. In most cases, whatever the topic, they will do the same thing. They'll allow you to write something and then let other people respond. If you're lucky there will be a discussion.

The web is full of discussion. It's one of its most prominent architectural forms. Most of the web software created over the past however many years has been designed to promote discussion. And I like discussion. It's better face-to-face but the web brings interesting dimensions too. You can reach more people, have bigger discussions.

The problem is that I've become a little jaded with discussion. In the same way that I've become a little jaded with conferences and endless talk about how social will change the world. How we have these amazing tools at our disposal. I'd half agree. We have some of the means to create tools that will change the world. But I'm not sure we have many of the actual tools yet.

And this is the hard part. Using the incredible opportunity afforded by the internet takes design. Blogging was a revolution. It enabled people to discuss things in real time across the world, share ideas, change people's thinking. I'm just not entirely sure how much more thinking we need to do.

Of course, if anyone comments at all, they might point out that social tools have been used to make real change, support revolutions, co-ordinate efforts. And they have. But the tools weren't made for action. They were just repurposed. Like using a window as a door.

So, it comes back to architecture. The internet is full of the same spaces. However they're presented most of them come down to someone writing something and other people responding to it. It doesn't matter whether you call it a blog, a social platform or a community engagement portal, it's probably the same kind of thing with a different look.

This isn's a complaint against blogging. I like reading blogs and there are some great writers out there. But I'm not one of them. Sometimes I manage to write down my thoughts. Other times I fail. It's also not a complaint against social platforms. Twitter is crap but I still love it. I use lots of other crap stuff too. It's very human to be united in the appreciation of crap things.

What I hope I'm saying is that there's so much more potential. Publishing is not everything. What other internet architecture possibilities are there? Or at least what's out there already that we could use?

Most importantly, how can we use the enormous technological gift at our disposal to start doing something more than talking? At least as a complement to talking. I think it's exciting. I also think that we're in no better position to make the world better than we've ever been. But we're in no worse position either. It's what we do next that matters.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Very few architects get to build the interesting sort of buildings. I've worked with architects and a lot of the work was about specifying materials and methods and working out the order in which work should be done, checking what contractors had done etc. Some assess planning applications. Some design very nice loft conversions...
Anyway, to the meat of your post...
Most of the time, people don't think enough. The lack of critical thought can lead to bad results for our society, as we seem to hear in the news daily at present. The discussion about immigration in the US by US citizens on Radio 4 early this week rather alarmed me because of the combination of incorrect information and lack of critical thinking.
The sky will fall in if people don't think.
You can write, and you have your own unique view of things to share with people. Your posts are not too long. If the post is interesting, people might even prefer a longer post (that came out of some research, I think, but I can't remember where I read it).
I am utterly bemused why you think that it is necessary to write regularly or not write at all. I write every week, but I write very irregularly on my various blogs. One of them in particular still seems to get read daily, no matter how long I leave it between posts.
Making a difference? Yes. Blogging can make a difference. Sometimes, it's a small difference, but sometimes people make a big difference through a blog. My posts don't get read by masses of people, and few ever comment on any (although they more often comment via Twitter), but I find that if something I have written connects with even just one person, it feels worth the effort.
I really don't think that you should give up blogging.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Network Nuance</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I was going to write a post about ego getting in the way of progress. My thinking was that an almost unconquerable sense of self made real, meaningful collaboration difficult. If everyone gave fully of themselves, with no thought for personal gain/prestige/ownership then we'd get so much more done. 

Anyway, that's how I started out but then it went in a different direction. I began thinking about where that idea sits within the mechanics of networks and this is where a paradox crept in.

One of the most trumpeted features of networks is their ability to facilitate collaboration. The more connected we are the more we're able to collaborate and the more we'll get done. Surely. 

Except there's a counter-effect in networks. What they offer in collaborative possibilities they take away in collaborative dis-incentive. 

Before we were all so well connected it was much harder to rally people together for a cause. In economics speak there was a far greater barrier to entry if you wanted to create a movement, or at least spread an idea.

In short it was time-consuming and expensive. 

With this being the case people had to compromise. They might pick a cause that they mostly agreed with. They might overlook some of the unappealing ideologies or personalities because they were sufficiently in agreement with the over-arching principles and participants.

They might have even foreseen some inevitable, internal negotiations to contend with if they were to lick the whole thing into shape. 

Under these conditions it was possible to gather momentum, forge ahead with big ideas. 

But those barriers to entry no longer exist. And here's the dis-incentive. I might really like what you're doing but not feel it's quite right. Perhaps there's something about you I don't really like. The thing is, I no longer have to make do.

After all, in such a networked world with sufficiently accessible means of production I can easily do my own, slightly different thing. Perhaps I can gather a few like-minded people to the cause. Maybe it'll remain just me. 

This happens at scale. And before we know it we've created an entire spectrum of nuanced projects. All of them pulling in slightly different directions.

They may each achieve their own, tightly focused objectives but can they and at the macro level, can networks, successfully tackle the really big issues?]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Interesting post Simon. And I agree. Increasingly seeing top down collaboration work far more effectively than grass roots collaboration for all sorts of reasons.

On another note, I believe there is a big difference between collaboration in a network and collaboration in a community. Networks and communities tend to bring about different behaviours at different levels.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You could well be right, Simon - the friction in between the competing groups can pose real problems.
Just look at all of the different charities that exist to do, essentially, the same thing: save the world, save animals, save old people, save young people and so on.

For me, the really interesting point comes in the spaces between those groups when progress is actually made.
It's a bit like walking.  One group goes a bit to the left, the other group a bit to teh right building on what the first group did, and so on.  
So long as the groups are mutually aware and within the same space, collaborative, nuanced progress should be possible.

Additionally, I think that this is healthier, in the long run, than single service providers.  Just look at the difficulties faced by, let's say, local government and public service in their non-competitive environments...]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Protecting the Field</title>
  <link>https://mistergough.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/protecting-the-field/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've worked in a few overlapping areas in my life. They've all been about connecting people with experiences, one way or another. And in reality, more people do this for a job than might describe it that way.

I've worked in arts marketing, content creation, web development, service design and graphic design. In all those areas I've done pretty similar things: making stuff, testing it out, talking to people, trying again.

Throughout that time the thing that has most consistently irked me is the fervent belief that each of those areas is completely unlike any of the others.

When I worked in arts marketing I witnessed its gradual transition to "audience development". As if, for some reason, any kind of cultural activity was too special to be seen in the vicinity of the word "marketing".

I saw web development go through all sorts of convolutions, each one making it more complex and specialised than the previous, each one accompanied by continuous argument and niche-ism.

So, a recent article outlining the differences between Service Design and Lean (which I won't link to because I'm not writing that sort of post) gave me an incredible sense of deja vu, as much as its appearance is inevitable.

It's inevitable because some degree of separation is necessary, especially when a new area of work is being established. We need the labels to some extent so that things evolve, so that we can find common ground for discussion.

But there are never clear lines between one thing and another, in any field. And service design overlaps with more things than many of us might recognise. It overlaps with open innovation, marketing, ethnography, interaction design, information architecture, user experience and product design to name but a few.

Above all it most definitely overlaps with Lean, which shares a clearly articulated vision of delivering value for the customer.

The need to separate one field from another is what eventually kills it. If we have to defend what we do by entrenching ourselves even further into dogma than we miss the bigger picture.

However, if we recognise and apply the very best tools and ideas from every overlapping field and use those then we'll start to do our jobs better and deliver some real value.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree that a degree of separation is required in describing overlapping sectors, and, that appropriation of widely used terms is necessary but that this can become a distraction from the job in hand. 

There is also a lot of snobbery and fashion that affects use of language, as you noted, with the pointless move from "marketing" to "audience development" in the arts. It is easy to get bogged down in language and divided over labels...

People can debate terminology 'until the cows come home'. People reach common ground through shared language but only real common understanding through experience, and practice - more doing, less talking. 

The world is becoming more joined up and 21st century skills are about adaptability. As service designers, it is our job to help the customer get his/her job done, and in doing so we should continue to borrow and apply others ideas theories and practice, in pursuit of delivering value to the customer. It is our responsibility to adapt.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What would a completely social recruitment model look like; one where we really helped each other get work?</p><p>At the moment the largest recruitment platform is probably LinkedIn (or Twitter or Facebook, depending on what kind of work you do). They all work in slightly different ways, but they're all pretty basic when it comes to genuine, social recruitment.</p><p>I say this because I was just having a Twitter conversation with someone and it immediately became obvious where the flaws in all the current models are. On one hand the process is messy and pretty random (finding work through Twitter perhaps). On the other hand it's competitive and self-serving (LinkedIn with its peacock feathers and scratch-my-back Endorsements).</p><p>Specifically I'm wondering what truly co-created recruitment would be. Co-created recruitment would move us away from a transactional model to more of a shared value, properly social one. Instead of our suitability for work being based on what we've previously done (and listed) or what we can think of that that we're good at (and also listed) it would present an opportunity for our skills and experience to emerge through social interaction.</p><p>In other words, we put up a starting point for what we can do but our social network helps us to build this into a more rich and accurate picture of what we're capable of. People who know us can add and suggest new things and this builds a better picture of us for people with work that needs to be done.</p><p>Obviously that's only part of the possibilities for a truly social model. The added advantages are that this co-creative activity is network-based which means that endorsements are more implied and emergent than simply traded. It also bridges people directly with work opportunities through the same network.</p><p>Most importantly a real social model could take away one of the hardest parts of parading ourselves online: knowing what to write. A more iterative, social model takes care of that.</p><p>Anyway, as in so many areas, the social recruitment models we have seem to be based on legacy architecture (online CVs) rather than the architecture we need to realise the full potential. What do you think the new models of social recruitment might look like?</p>]]></content:encoded>

One of the things they do is try to match online conversations with how we talk offline.

  <title>The Illusion of Change</title>
  <link>https://mistergough.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/the-illusion-of-change/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Tonight I'm paying my first visit to something called "innopints". It's a loose, occasional gathering started by George Julian I think (<a href="http://georgeblogs.wordpress.com/2011/10/23/innovators-are-constantly-asking-why-things-aren%E2%80%99t-done-differently-the-return-of-innopints/" target="_blank">here's one of her earlier articles about it</a>).

The theme is "change". It's a fairly open topic but, in the absence of any other guidance I've written some of my own thoughts on the subject below.

So...

Does the networked era mean that the illusion of change far outstrips the reality?

<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/19/time-to-accelerate" target="_blank">This Wired article</a> suggests that we're living in one of the least innovative periods in recent history. And yet every day seems like a constant barrage of innovation.

So, is this innovation just talk or is it simply that the nature of change itself has changed? Does all the innovation add up to a new kind of change that can't be measured in relation to the achievements of the past or is all the talk just a smokescreen for the limited amount of doing?

I think there's some truth in the latter. One of the most telling signs, perhaps, is the gradual shift in meaning of the word "tech".

Tech used to be a largely hardware word. In recent history we've seen the invention of the computer, the mobile phone and the internet. Now, however, the word tech rarely seems to refer to much outside of the creation of new websites.

But does it matter? Are we at the end of one sort of change and in the midst of another? Poverty, disease and environmental destruction would suggest otherwise. Given how much radical change is needed perhaps there isn't anywhere near enough of it.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Balance Sheet</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently became rather irritated by accountancy. It all kicked off when Maria Miller, the government culture person talked about how the arts should demonstrate its value. By which she means how much money it makes.

Naturally this upset a lot of people. It annoyed me too. The real value of art and culture cannot be measured in money. It's essential. If you think otherwise then you've pretty much missed the point of civilisation. Like the government I suppose.

But actually, it's pretty easy to demonstrate some monetary value from arts funding. If not comprehensively then at least it's possible to demonstrate enough "profit" to zip the lips of the detractors. After all, look at all those tourists coming to see Big Theatre. Add all that up. Add up the blockbuster exhibitions and the tourist spend. Add up all the music and films and books.

Basically there's loads of it. But will it be counted? After all, how long did it take Danny Boyle to go from his theatre days to putting out major films like Slumdog Millionaire (which alone grossed the equivalent of the Arts Council's annual budget)? YEARS. If you're an accountant you won't be relating those two figures.

And if you're looking at what you're spending on theatre and exhibitions now, the promise of millions from its by-products a couple of decades down the line isn't going to cut it. But that's how it works. Cutting edge art is cutting edge R&amp;D. And then some. It builds people, ideas, communities. It creates the conditions for creativity, ideas, innovations, making things and generally everything that people in government like to talk about without having the faintest idea what they mean.

So, the chances are that people in the arts will struggle to demonstrate their economic value. Not because it doesn't exist, but because it doesn't work on a yearly cycle, like a business. But pretty much nothing in the economy works on a yearly cycle, like a business. Because the economy is not a business. The problem with money as a token of value is not money itself, but time.

We're obsessed with short term money. The investors on Dragon's Den want to see a return yesterday. Alan Sugar wants to see some profit in a couple of days. People want to go from never having sung in public to having a million-pound record deal.

And in these circumstances, the only things that come out on top are the most basic forms of trade: buying and selling, overnight success. The reason we love banking so much is because it generates instant profit from air. What could possibly beat that?

So it's not just arts people that need to worry. Because this is what defines everything. We invest in business people to develop their businesses because it's quicker. We support entrepreneurs because we'll turn a faster profit. It's like healthcare: all cure and no prevention.

The real opportunities for the economy are somewhere else altogether. They're in schools and communities. They're in families. They're unemployed people and children. They're people who have never even considered running a business. They're the massive, untapped capacity in people that have never even been to a networking event.

But investing in all those opportunities to build a world-beating economy isn't going to pay off any time soon. You'd just be investing in people because you thought that people were worth investing in. And who's going to do that?]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Adoption, Labels and Expectations</title>
  <link>https://mistergough.wordpress.com/2013/06/25/adoption-labels-and-expectations/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Almost forty-two years ago I was given away. For one reason or another my birth mother was unable to keep me. I'm sure it wasn't an easy decision, in fact I know she had a good reason. The fact that, to this day, I've no idea who my real father is probably goes some way to illuminating the circumstances. 

Anyway, she was eighteen. I doubt that many people have their lives together at eighteen. I know I didn't.

After a brief stint with foster parents I was adopted. From what I understand adoption is a long drawn out process. At least it was then. It's remarkable how much more difficult it is to provide a home for an unwanted baby than it is to make one.

Anyway, I wanted to write something about this because I saw that there was a new series coming on television about families being reunited and I wanted to share my experiences in case they were of use to anyone. I can't say I'm typical, but then nobody is.

Almost fifteen years ago I got it into my head that I wanted to find my birth mother. I was well aware that there were official channels for that kind of thing but, being a bit of a research geek, I decided to give the process a go myself. 

In reality it only took half a day of digging around in Islington records office to find the information I needed. As it turned out there were a couple of people with the same maiden name as my birth mother (I had an original birth certificate) living in the same area where I was born. I rang them. We had a rather cagey conversation. My assumption that they were my birth grandparents was right. Later that day I had a call from a woman I'd never spoken to before.

"Do you know who I am?" I said.
"Yes, I think I do."
"Hello."

And that was it. Shortly after the phone call I got a lift with a friend to where my birth mother lived. We met. It was a very odd experience. I can't think of any better way of describing it.

She introduced me to some half-siblings, two boys and a girl. The eldest boy was almost my age and, to me, felt a bit like looking into a mirror. We're not exactly twins, but meeting blood relations for the first time messes with your perceptions somewhat. 

The thing is, at this point in my life, right now, I no longer have any real contact with them. The other people in my life find this odd and it's hard to explain, but I wanted to give it a go. Which is partly what this post is about. 

As someone who's adopted I've spent a significant part of my life thinking something was missing. Other people have told me pretty much the same thing. Any bad patches I went through could be easily explained through my particular life circumstances. It helps to have a label for people. Adoption is a useful label.

But eventually truths can become unavoidable obstacles and so my morning in the records office was inevitable; a long time coming. I needed to find the missing part. 

What I learned from all this was that missing parts are sometimes never found. All the time I thought that what was missing was a person. As it turned out it was something much more than that. It was a person plus time together and the person without the time together was nowhere near enough.

So I decided to let the relationship go. There are other reasons but those reasons involve other people and it's not fair to write about them here.

I'm intending to catch that television series if I can. I'd love to know what other people's experiences are like. How much they'll really, truthfully, come across on television I don't know. But it's still interesting to me.

All I'd like to say to anyone intending to find birth parents or similarly misplaced relatives is to try and approach it as rationally as possible. I know it probably sounds ridiculous given the emotional circumstances, but expectations are important. Finding someone who should have been part of your life isn't going to bring back that part of your life. If you're lucky you'll meet someone you really get on with. You might want to develop a new relationship, but it <em>will</em> be a new relationship and should be treated as such. 

Now I have a new family and it's something different. It's good to make new things, especially when you're in control. Creating your own life is a lot better than trying to fix the one somebody else messed up. At least that's how I feel. 

Of course, none of this has stopped me wanting to find my real father, but I hope that if I do pursue it then at least I'll be better prepared for what it brings.   Or doesn't.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thank you, Simon. This moved me, and I had to go away for a bit . First I responded to your honesty and compassion. Then, I responded to your narrative. As someone who works with storytelling, I felt the dull thud as you said you no longer have contact with them. That's not how we see it in the movies.  But this is a true story, and truth doesn't always meet our expectations.

I went away to mull it over. I had a friend who gave up a baby when she was sixteen, and that daughter found her, and now they are friends. I had a client whose mother gave him up, and took his sister to Australia. They met fifty years later, by which time his sister was a Professor of Psychology, and she said "I always knew something was missing."

Which brings me to my story. I was loved as a child, and I knew who my birth parents were, and I always felt something was missing. And over time, I've come to accept that was just my curiosity and yearning, and the people I had around me don't always make everything right.  

But it was very tempting, especially as a child, to believe that I had to go on a quest, and bring home the golden fleece, and then my parents and I can be healed  Instead of thinking that lots of bits of the world are a bit crap, and I can be one of the smart, honest compassionate people that improves it.

Thank you.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>The Skiing Analogy</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Apologies for writing about such a middle class activity, but one of the most fascinating things I learned about the human brain I learned in a skiing lesson.

Basically, it's this: DO NOT LOOK AT THE THING YOU WANT TO AVOID.

It's fascinating because it's a clear reminder that the little dialogues in our heads are nothing in comparison to the ape-like urges. However much we look at a rock and say to ourselves, "See that rock? We need to go round that," chances are that we'll hit it.

And it applies everywhere. Look at social media. The Daily Mail publishes something typically dreadful and we all talk about it; we show our disgust for The Apprentice by watching it and talking about it; there's a hashtag about failings in the NHS and we make it trend by complaining about it. Yes, I do all these things.

Social media make us keep skiing into rocks when we should be concentrating on the clear paths, the better discussions, the more valuable uses of our time. Making things better. Making better things.]]></content:encoded>

Yes, you're right. Social is a way to spread the "OMG Did you see THAT!" vibe which prompts our human curiosity.

However, it's also good for sharing great stuff, helping us do bigger and better things.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[From birth onwards, at every point in our lives, we're fully-formed human beings; neither too young or too old. There's nothing else we need to be and no more we need to learn. 

In this respect, the notion that people have "potential" is a false one. The idea of potential automatically implies that it's unfulfilled. It's like saying someone isn't good enough yet.

Two of the most well-known methodologies of software development are Waterfall and Agile; and, with apologies to software developers, I'm going to summarise them here. 

Waterfall involves developing a full specification for a piece of software, based on the most complete understanding of its final use we can possibly gain. Then, each component of that software is built, often in separate teams, and generally in stages. At any point up to completion it's highly unlikely there will be any kind of usable product.

Agile, on the other hand, aims to build a workable (however crudely) product at every iteration. It assumes that the final specification cannot be fully understood. It also generally involves more people working together, across departments.

With those two massive over-simplifications in mind it seems to me that our current education system is the worst kind of Waterfall methodology. We teach abstract components based on some, at best, future specification of what a fully-assembled human being should look like. At worst we're using a past specification. 

The reality is that we can't predict that future specification. We can't guess at what will make a person most useful in ten years time. And it does seem to me that most of the talk is around usefulness. 

Instead we need more Agile education. We should respect the fact that a person is a finished product at every stage of their life. We're not building something for the future, we're helping someone be as good as they can be right now. 

And the outcome of this is that they will provide the specification for the future, not vice versa.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment. With regard to the Facebook question: firstly, I'm not aware of any system that works precisely like this. There are elements of it in unschooling (which is our approach with our children) and some elements of it in the Summerhill School approach, which is more democratic.

I see what I've talked about here as having a number of key elements:

1. There are no subjects. Subjects, as far as I'm concerned, make no sense in the real world. They map onto very little in the world of work and are generally arbitrary. Project-based learning would be central to the Agile approach. Project-based learning also fits with the idea of making knowledge useful and complete at every stage.

2. There is no concept of difficulty. If a child wants to learn about astrophysics and philosophy then that is supported. If you follow point 1. above then that knowledge will just be part of the project that is being undertaken. Outside of school, if children ask questions, a parent does their best to answer them, whatever they are about. This follows the idea that it is better to have a crude knowledge of something in its entirety rather than a full knowledge of an abstract component of it.

3. There are no classes. Children are free to mix with any other children based on projects rather than age of subjects. This also improves socialisation.

4. There are no teachers. Teaching, in its current form, assumes that knowledge is being fed down to people (to some extent). In a Agile system the assumption would be that no one person had a complete understanding of what was being learned. The relationship would be more of a facilitated one with highly specialised knowledge being sought according to need.

5. And this is a really important one: everything is related to the real world, as it happens. In an Agile system the learners would be engaged in an ongoing dialogue with whatever was going outside. And this would be two-way. They would work on real projects, learn from them and feed into them. Business / public sector / voluntary / local / global / etc.

6. Accreditation would be built-in and simultaneous rather than retrospective. Accreditation would also not be entirely individual. There are enough studies showing that rewarding teams is better than rewarding individuals to warrant some sort of hybrid system here. Accreditation could be specifically tied to delivery of a project rather than just understanding.

There are many more I'm sure...]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't agree with the first two sentences of your post, so I guess I shouldn't expect to agree with the rest. If you take the notion of time out of human existence, you miss the journey, you miss the dynamic, you miss the growth. So I can see why you wouldn't find any joy in potential. 

I can't comment on your notion of a fully-assembled human being should look like, but I don't think they should look like a newborn baby, lovely as babies are.  That sounds more like The Matrix. 

I draw a lot of comfort from feeling that tomorrow need not be like today. I intend to be different tomorrow, and I hope not merely to change the world, but shape it, the better to fulfil human purposes, that are not just personal but shared, not just innate but shared and acquired, not just abstract but embodied, and not stationary but evolving and growing.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment. You say you disagree, but your point seems to be the same as mine. It's exactly the fact that it's about the journey, who we are at every stage of our lives, that matters. Potential, and learning towards some future goal, negates this. It says that you are incomplete until you get to the end. I'm not suggesting people remain like babies, just that babies are perfect at the time they're babies. And so we are at every age.

Tomorrow is absolutely not like today, hence the madness of building education around some perceived future requirement.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I do not agree entirely with your dismissal of the importance of time. But I like your description of agile education, and this approach is much more likely to be effective than in software development, which is an unmitigated engineering disaster area.

The biggest problem with most of the education system in the UK is that is it self-serving; it pays little attention to its actual purpose. And the main cause is that most teachers have no experience of anything other than education.

People go to school, then university, some of them undergo teacher training and go back into schools to teach more people. Others of them study further and some of those become university lecturers remaining in universties to teach more people.

It's no wonder that, unless you end up as a professor at a world class university, at some point you must (according to the educational view) have failed or dropped out. The education that we got was a side effect of the false purpose that the education profession pursues.

Hence, many of the most successful businesses are run by "drop outs"!]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Short Essay Published on the Internet</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I started out by writing a blog post. That was until it occurred to me how much I hated the words "blog" and "post". They've become overused and cliched, like so many other words that refer to things.

What I really wanted to do, rather than trot out another tired instance of something everyone understands, is simply write down some of my thoughts. 

But what an awful word: "thoughts". We see it everywhere now. When people have been thinking and there's been some kind of outcome they're all too eager to slap the "thought" label on it; not really thinking at all. 

The problem with using all these words for things is that it's very hard to get across to you how edgy and forward-thinking I am. When I'm speaking at conferences, for example, I know that I only have a few minutes to establish my credentials as an innovator; particularly the kind of innovator that wouldn't dream of using the word "innovator".

If I can't engage my audience through our shared dislike of the word "engage" then I fear we may never connect. And they'll consider me the sort of person that might say "connect".

So I hope that, regardless of anything else you might take away from what I've written here, you'll remember that I wasn't afraid to dismiss some commonly-used words. And I hope that in some small way it will enable us to find a sort of synergy.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>"Gray goo (also spelled grey goo) is a hypothetical end-of-the-world scenario involving molecular nanotechnology in which out-of-control self-replicating robots consume all matter on Earth while building more of themselves." - Wikipedia</p></blockquote><p>Or perhaps it's looking at Spotify or the Kindle and realising that there's so much digital stuff with less and less to differentiate it that you can't be bothered to look for anything new. Maybe it's even finding something new and listening to it once or just reading the first few pages.</p><p>I even have stuff favourited and downloaded that I can't be bothered to listen to or read once. The grey screen of my Kindle has become its own grey goo. I'm not being eaten alive by self-replicating robots; I'm just losing the will to open books. And when I lose the will to engage with art, culture and information then the grey goo has won.</p><p>The fault doesn't lie with digital technology, it's just that I'm not connecting personally, deeply with the things that I once would have. The act of going into a shop and buying a book or a CD requires investment. It takes effort and time. So I work at it. I make sure I read the book. I listen to the CD a few times (even if I don't like it at first).</p><p>How do we replicate this personal investment for the digital age? How do we enter into that contract with the things that other people have created? It's not a social issue, it's a personal one. And I'm not sure we have the mechanisms for it yet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You know your problem, Simon? <em>You're not consuming enough.</em> You're just acquiring metadata, more and more pointers. (Don't feel embarrased, the NSA  does it too.)

I'm looking around my dining room and I can see four or five kinds of food that I bought for Christmas. And then ten days in a row I decided not to eat them. Consumption has had a bad rap  over the last few years; we've been told it's passive, but it's actually very fulfilling. The music we listen to, the books we read and the food we eat are the ones that actually change us in some way. 

It's good to have access to stuff; engaging with it is another matter. Engagement is the thing. But apart from when I was fifteen and spent way too much money on a new release by some achingly hip band, I soon got out of the habit of feeling I had to finish one thing before I started the next.

Now if you don't mind, there's a mixtape on SoundCloud I need to neglect.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for capturing this, Simon. Maybe it relates to our need to cultivate digital literacies, an issue described, at least in a social media context, by Howard Rheingold here: http://rheingold.com/netsmart/. Or, at least, I believe that it is; I haven't read it yet ;-) However, I have seen him speak on the subject.

Interestingly his emphasis is less on identifying valuable things to do/read/watch/hear, and more on "crap detection", which is the inverse: finely tuning our processes of filtering what not to spend our attention on.

Another of his points is that, as the quantity of available material has increased, our obligations have changed. It is not a queue of items to be handled, it is a flow to be sampled. This may be reiterating what Gordon has said about not needing to finish one thing before starting another.

Overall, it seems to me that, digital communication has given us far more than it has taken away because there is so much more to choose from, but we do need to learn to be more selective. As the saying goes: "take it easy,... but take it!"]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Love this, Simon. Love. It.

Digital is wonderful for speed and rabbit hole consumption, but the very things which make it awesome make it harder for us to engage fully with the content.

Remixing, reusing, rethinking those things which we hit with the onetime Like/click is so difficult, because there's more piling in all of the time.

So, perhaps we need to look at this from other angle.

It's not what the technology does for us, but what we do for the technology.

Do we gift ourselves the time to go back and read what we thought was interesting?  Do we set aside a couple of hours of sorting and reflection time to make the best use of what we've discovered?

Or do we pile ahead and accumulate more pixel junk along the way.

Perhaps the speed of the tech isn't the issue, it's our own ever increasing dive forward which needs to be arrested...]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment, and the link (I've saved it to Pocket. :)). I agree that filtering is an issue, and that we're dealing with a flow. Digital communication has given us a huge amount but I think our own systems for dealing with the exponential growth in information may still be some way behind the curve. And we're only a fraction of the way towards being able to take full advantage of everything it offers.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I was intrigued by <a href="https://www.theamazings.com/pages/moving-on" target="_blank">this article</a> on the closure of The Amazings. I don't know much about the organisation and how well it was run but the concept reminded me of some others I'd seen recently.

Who could not like the underlying principle of The Amazings? Connect up skilled and experienced older people with other people eager to learn. A great principle. But what about the idea? There have been plenty of comments on the way in which The Amazings was run but what if the idea was bad? How would we know?

The thing about bad ideas is that opinion doesn't really matter. The only way of testing ideas is to put them into action. In most cases this works, but when principles are involved we get problems.

By confusing principles with ideas we run the risk of prolonging the bad ideas. Principles attract the sort of funding that doesn't care how viable and sustainable the idea is. Principles attract the sort of support that makes everyone believe there's a good idea.

And so the bad, unsustainable ideas keep going. Until the money runs out.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Half-Formed Thoughts on Connections and Consciousness</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was thinking about what we really meant by “connections”. We talk about them all the time but what do they actually look like? We tend to describe them as either a vague concept, as in “there's a connection”, or we talk about an external mechanism somewhere in the space between people, like social media. But what does a connection actually look like?<br /> <br /> A couple of books I’ve been reading made me think about the internal and external worlds of our lives, the places we inhabit in our heads and the interactions we have with other people. I was particularly drawn to ways of looking at art and design, and wondering whether we could describe the differences in this way:<br /> <br /> “The artist meets us in their world; the designer meets us in ours.”<br /> <br /> It’s a simplification, and these things are never just about meeting, but I couldn’t find a particularly good way of describing how an artist brings us into their inner world in order to help us explore ours and a designer enters our world to understand how to connect it with theirs. Or something like that.<br /> <br /> Either way, it did seem interesting to consider the internal exploration of the artist versus the external exploration of the designer. These internal and external spaces, and the way we use them, potentially offer different perspectives on what we mean by “connection”. Somewhere between our innermost consciousness and that of someone else lies a connection point.<br /> <br /> Depending on how self-centred each of us are that connection point lies deeper within one person than the other. We could probably even plot the point somewhere on a kind of diagram. Maybe someone has. But how does it apply to the people around us? What does the way someone writes (or makes music, has conversations) suggest about where these connection points lie for them? And how much are they aware of it?</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Interesting thinking Simon. The analogy of the designer meeting us in our world made me think of the old adage that the best design goes completely unnoticed.

When a product or service is so well designed that interacting with it is almost intuitive the designer has successfully connected with you on your terms. On the other hand, when your experience is unintuitive, complicated or just down right confusing you have to adjust your own frame of mind, move out of your own world, before you can properly connect.

I know I'm moving away from interpersonal connections there, but your half-formed thought half-formed a few of my own.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Things That Aren't The Actual Things</title>
  <link>https://mistergough.wordpress.com/2014/01/20/things-that-arent-the-actual-things/</link>

I'm re-reading Scott McCloud's excellent Understanding Comics. Early in the book he "talks" about Magritte's The Treachery of Images ("Ceci n'est pas une pipe") and things that are not really things.

His comment on the fact that in the book you're looking at a printed reproduction of a drawing of a painting of a pipe is intriguing. It seems absurd to paint a pipe and then write underneath that it isn't a pipe, but it's entirely correct, and a wonderful statement on too many things to talk about in a short blog post.

However, this prompted me to think back on a number of conversations I've had recently, around the danger of things that are not the actual things; more specifically the things we choose to communicate other things, and how our entire world is built around these.

I suppose I'm also talking about a particular type of communication: the sort we use to communicate something complex to someone else so that we can create a shared understanding. In the absence of a better term I'd probably call these "abstraction layers".

We create abstraction layers through a need to standardise the interfaces between different things. Let's take architect's blueprints as a case in point. Why do architect's produce blueprints? Well, one of the main reasons is to help communicate with people who aren't architects: builders, quantity surveyors, engineers, etc.

On the face of it those blueprints seem like a great idea. Here are widely understood methods of communication that many different professions can work with. But the problem with these, and with many other things in the same category, is that they begin to grow in importance, they begin to suck everything else into them.

Everyone's working practices start to bend to the will of the blueprint. Systems are put in place, there's version control, things become legally binding, components become standardised and, ultimately, compromises are made to accommodate the needs of the blueprint.

And so, ultimately, do we sacrifice more than we gain through our focus on these abstraction layers and interfaces between people? And do we stop thinking about the things itself: the building?

Let's take a simpler example: qualifications. Why do we have these? We want to be able to communicate all of our knowledge and experience in shorthand. We want to present to a potential employer, in a couple of lines of text, everything we're capable of.

And what does this lead to? It leads to a fetishism of qualifications. They become what we work towards, instead of working towards what they represent. We look for shortcuts, work-arounds, quick-fixes. They become the focus, the things that aren't the actual things.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a decade ago I went into a record shop in Soho and asked about a forthcoming release by a DJ/producer called Will Saul. I was really into his stuff at the time.</p><p>The shop assistant picked up her phone...</p><p>"Will, hi! Yeah, OK. No. Did you? Really? Look, when's the album out? Monday? Thanks."</p><p>You get the idea. She called Will Saul. Thing is, I imagine he was pretty busy given that his record was due out that coming Monday. More to the point, record shops tend to get lists of releases, with the dates on.</p><p>So, why did she call him? Well, because she knew Will Saul. And she wanted me to know that she knew Will Saul. She wanted me witness her network; something she'd never have managed to do by just answering the question. You could argue that she was sourcing good information. I'd argue that she wasn't.</p><p>Here's another record shop example. Let's just say that I wanted to find some new music but wasn't sure what I was looking for. There are two ways for a record shop to deal with this:</p><ol><li>Play something they really like and see if I like it too</li><li>Interrogate me about genres and what I'm into</li></ol><p>I'd like it if they did 1. Chances are they'd go for 2. You might think 2 is the better option (after all, it seems pretty research-driven and user-focused) but as far as I'm concerned that option, and the scenario I talked about at the start, are one and the same thing.</p><p>In other words:</p><ol><li>Who you know</li><li>What you know</li></ol><p>What they both equate to is a demonstration of relative importance. It's the equivalent of telling someone just how much you know about what they're asking but not giving them an answer. It clarifies your importance as a node, without revealing the vulnerability of your opinion.</p><p>Sometimes when we ask people questions we'd most value that vulnerability. That vulnerability is one of the ingredients of a truly engaging user experience, of putting someone else first. And it doesn't feed off our ignorance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently read <a title="Personal Kanban" href="http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/personal-kanban-the-book/#sthash.oSTYptKw.dpbs" target="_blank">Personal Kanban</a>, which I thoroughly recommend, especially if you want to get away from the tyranny of to-do lists. In other words, I'd recommend it to everyone.</p><p>One of the themes of the book is the distinction between capacity and flow; neatly described in terms of road traffic. A road at full capacity - in other words with no space between the cars - doesn't move at all. A road with adequate space between the cars will flow.</p><p>Put this way it's clear how disadvantageous it is for things that need to move to be at full capacity. Full capacity is great for a glass of wine, not so good for living.</p><p>The space between tasks is as essential part of doing things better rather than just doing more. In Kanban this space largely relies upon being disciplined with the amount of Work in Progress (WiP), i.e. the number of tasks that are supposedly being actioned at the same time.</p><p>But this approach to work, creating thinking/breathing/enjoying space, means much more. By making this space we start to see the individual parts of our work; we start to see the separation between one thing and another. And moving from lists to defined entities changes our perspective.</p><p>So the concept of work/life balance is shown to be a very blunt instrument indeed. Our days are full of individual tasks, none of which wholly encapsulate either work or "life". And neither an unbroken continuum nor polar opposites are effective ways to view them.</p><p>By focusing on separation, the line between one thing and another, it's possible to give everything the respect it deserves, however much space we're able to create for ourselves.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently came to the conclusion that I never really learn much from books. If I was to rank the ways in which I actually learn it would look a little like this:</p><ol><li>Having a go myself</li><li>Having it demonstrated</li><li>The internet</li><li>Books</li></ol><p>The first three are, in some way or another, conversations. Even when I think about other people explaining things to me I'm really thinking about having my specific questions answered, not being talked at or presented to; not being lectured. And it's the same with the internet. I don't mean that I learn by reading whole websites. I mean that I use search; I have a question and I search for the answer.</p><p>Sometimes search brings me into the world of other people trying to understand the same things, and allows me to follow their own quest to find an answer. For me this shared experience is a key part of learning. When we learn from others in a similar position we get both answers and empathy. We find a solution and we connect with it. When we discover that answer for ourselves it's even more powerful.</p><p>Questions, answers and empathy seem to be fundamental to my learning experience, which is why being fed learning doesn't work for me and why the authority of the educator isn't enough. I admire expertise but I don't necessarily learn from it. Especially written down.</p><p>In this respect it seems that the most promising element of ebooks is far from being realised. We have the technology to connect over books and go on the same journey with others but it's not really happening; margin notes are a poor substitution for conversation.</p><p>I still enjoy books and in reality most reading experiences are about more than just information. But few things in our lives have changed as little over time as books. Most technological advancements have been about the business model of books rather than their format. If we'd put as much effort into the learning experience as we have the commercial aspect, what would books look like now?</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the best graphic designers I ever met never used a computer. In fact he predominantly used a photocopier and pair of scissors. Once he'd roughed out some ideas with cut and paste he'd talk to other people to get everything into digital files; he'd work with a typesetter, an artist, an illustrator.

He produced some great work, and it was real teamwork. But it wasn't just internal teamwork, it was client collaboration too. Everything began with a meeting. We'd sit down together and work through the design as if we were both working on it. He'd cut things out, stick them together. Scissors, sticky tape, pencils, democratic tools. We'd look at typeface catalogues together, discuss colours.

Nothing was ever thrown over the wall. I didn't send him a brief and wait for something to come back. He didn't pass on a finished design to the typesetters. Projects remained in flux, part of a conversation, until the final piece of work was produced.

I've thought more and more recently about how I want to continue this tradition in the small amount of graphic design work I do. And to help with that I've been considering projects in four stages.

<h2>1. Purpose</h2>
Where does the purpose of graphic design come from? In many cases a client will decide that some work needs doing and have some idea of what the brief for that should be. This becomes enshrined in a document that forms the basis of the designer's work. But how likely is this to produce the right outcome?

A good designer will go back to a client with questions, attempt to clarify the brief. But how much is this ever a conversation and how much time is wasted when it isn't? This discussion, a step before anything visible is even produced, could be the most important part of the design process, so how do we ensure that it isn't just a handover?

<h2>2. Paper</h2>
Once the Purpose is established it might seem like the perfect time to sit down alone and design stuff. After all, designers are magicians. It's important that others don't see what goes on behind the scenes. Except that my fondest memories of working with a graphic designer involved sitting down together and producing material there and then.

Of course much of this was rough, photocopied drafts. But it gave us a shared understanding. It also saved a huge amount of time and the reason that when I took a course in graphic design I chose one without computers. This way of working can be really liberating.

<h2>3. Pixels</h2>
Things get more tricky when computers are involved. Much of the standard design software can show full screen, menu-free views of the work in progress so that the mysteries of digital design remain hidden away. We don't want people to see us nudging things around on the screen, experimenting when we should already know what we're doing.

But when we work together, look at the same things, we start to share an understanding of the tools we're using. Beyond static, visual design work, this can take us into other territories. What if we write code and edit websites together? How far can we move from the expert and proprietary technology model to the shared, open model?

Every job we do, everything we create for someone else, is an opportunity to share the tools and deepen the learning. It doesn't make everyone a graphic designer, but it does make graphic designers better, and better understood for what they specifically bring rather than what they are generally selling.

<h2>4. Polish</h2>
Surely here's where the designer should disappear, with some paper cutouts and rough Photoshop files, before returning with a shiny masterpiece? Except that there's huge opportunity at this point. The real craft of graphic design, the part that matters, is the attention to detail that leads to almost imperceptible tweaks.

Graphic designers who really care about what they do will obsess over minor differences in colour, typefaces, gradients, details. And in many ways it's these obsessions that form the basis of stronger client relationships. Sharing an understanding, and love, of why two ostensibly similar things are actually worlds apart is key to mutual trust and building something meaningful for the long-term.

I recently did a project with some graphic design students, getting them to work on new ideas for services and products. It was hard to get them away from their computers but when they weren't using Photoshop they were doing their best work.

The conversations I had with those students, their tutor, and many other people since has highlighted what a solitary profession graphic design can be, and how much better it can be when it isn't.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Walls of the Universe</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[There's an exercise called The Five Whys. You may have heard of it. The aim is to keep asking "why?" until you get back to the root of an issue. It's a good exercise; it teaches us not to accept face value, but it also makes an assumption. It almost makes us believe that we are capable of a broad perspective, that we can fully escape the context of something.

Last week I was in another country, talking to someone about education. I have a lot of conversations about education, some self-initiated, others through no fault of my own. My position on education is pretty clear: I think that school is fundamentally wrong. I think that subjects, lessons, teachers and grades comprise the worst possible way for children to learn.

Most of the time, when I'm talking to people in the UK, I can get this point across relatively easily. Not everyone agrees with it but more people than you might imagine will happily consider the perspective.

Most people in the UK don't realise how easy it is to take their children out of school here. Many don't even realise it's possible. Any yet they're often very quick to accept the fact, and engage with the possibilities.

However, in those countries where schooling is compulsory it's a very different picture. What's most noticeable is that many of the people in those countries find it really difficult to engage with the unschooling perspective on education. It's almost like we hit a wall.

But this post isn't about education, it's about context. What fascinates me about people in places where home education is illegal is that it often seems to define their perspective on it. I'm not generalising or saying it's true of everyone but the conversations I've had, where we appear to reach a limit of understanding, a fundamental disconnect, seem to suggest some hard-wiring.

This will be true of people in the UK on other topics of course. There will be things that are so programmed into us that almost no amount of "Five Whying" will enable us to escape our preconceptions. This seems increasingly the case when we talk about "digital".

Free will is an impossible concept. I was watching my daughter playing Flappy Bird on my phone and thinking about this stupid notion of "Digital Natives". Beyond all the assumptions that Digital is Good and that The Web Will Save Us, there are more damaging justifications around children's relationship with technology.

When we talk about how much children are into screens and technology we forget that we've created this context for them. In many cases screens are thoroughly absorbing for children purely because they're better than the rest of the crap we've made for them. Ask yourself whether you'd rather learn your times tables or play Minecraft. It doesn't mean that Minecraft is the future. It just means that times tables aren't.

So, sometimes we have to remember that we haven't made anything particularly brilliant; we've just created a little escape valve. The things we think are brilliant only seem that way because we mentally can't escape the context we live in. But we do need to escape that context, whether it's there because of society, or law, or our democratic system, or our love of technology. Sometimes it's there just because the alternative is impossible to comprehend, like a universe with no end.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Instead of imagining that we're creating perpetual engines with our ideas, a little push in the right direction to conquer the world, let's imagine that all ideas are fundamentally stupid and work back from their inevitable demise.

Here's a handy formula:

<a href="http://mistergough.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/stupidity.png"><img src="http://mistergough.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/stupidity.png" alt="Stupidity Formula" width="545" height="235" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-395" /></a>

i = the level of investment required
s = the stupidity of the idea
t = the length of time you want people to think the idea isn't stupid

Note that s is squared. Stupid ideas have an exponential impact on everything.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The last couple of weeks saw the sad demise of a really great app, How Do. It allowed you to take pictures of the steps involved in doing something interesting and leave some audio commentary along the way. It was a treasure trove of wonderful little tips and tricks, but sadly it's no more.

The thing is, I never properly used it. Yes, I browsed what was on there, and I had it installed on my phone. But never once did I leave a tip myself. I don't know what caused its founders to pull the plug but I'm sure I wasn't the only one to like the idea without fully engaging.

When you're looking at your phone all the time, when it's your window on the world, it's very easy to use those apps that involve nothing more than your brain and your phone. There's little to separate a thought and a tweet. It's even easier to engage with something that starts and ends at the same interface; we can all retweet and we can all share links.

But when an app requires you to engage with the real world and create something that starts somewhere else, like when you're cooking, we end up with a sort of reality friction. We forget that the app exists. We remember when it's too late.

Marketing people grapple with a similar issue: Top of Mind. Companies like Coca Cola devote almost their entire marketing spend to one thing. When you go into a shop with a thirst they want you to think of Coke. At the crucial point they want you to associate Coke with Quenching. It's a split second decision; millions spent on a moment.

Most apps don't have that kind of budget, or the inclination to invest in what it takes to achieve that traditional ubiquity. So what do they do? Beyond the initial flurry of interest, how do they stay in our thoughts?

Recently I've noticed more and more Push Notifications in Foursquare, a company that seems to be working on Top of Mind through direct action. And the technology works well for this purpose, however annoying it might be. GPS is the natural friend of Top of Mind for a geo-location app.

For many apps, however, there's a greater challenge. How do they know I'm baking a special cake? How do they know I'm tying a tricky knot? Technology gets us so far, like in the Foursquare example, but some of these challenges need deeper consideration.

If we're going to discover amazing things we need apps like How Do to thrive. It's not enough to know where someone is or what they're thinking. We want to engage vicariously with the physical world, the amazing things people can do, in ways that make us feel part of it. And yet it feels like we're still a long way off.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The word "experiment" seems to have two, almost different meanings. One one hand we think of it as a one-off, radical thing; experimental art and music are out there, crazy, avant garde. The opposite of systematic, methodical.

On the other hand we have science. Experiments in science are a core process. They're how we do science and they're very much systematic and methodical.

Lean Startup reminded me of this apparent dichotomy. Lean Startup experiments are designed, methodical, iterative, repetitive (if done properly). In fact they become one of the only truly meaningful ways to learn anything, in the same way that babies learn: trying something new, making mistakes, trying something different. Human beings all grow up this way and then at some point in our lives most of us start to lose the will to experiment.

Eventually we start to see the experiment as something outside our normal behaviour, rather than the mode of our behaviour. If we're not careful we apply this outside view to everything in life. We forget that methodical concepts like strategy are heavily reliant on experiment. Rather than strategy being a known entity we execute, strategy is simply a framework for experiment, and what we do naturally as babies we need to design as adults.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was originally going to write something about a subtractive view of design, or rather how design should focus more on how to take things away than how to create. </p><p>After all, truly good designs simplifies, removes obstacles, eliminates problems. Good design brings clarity, reduces uncertainty. And yet we often think of design in terms of what we create, of the shiny newness. Whether it's the tangible output or the tools of the process we're always adding.</p><p>But even the most tangible of design objects, the prototype, is primarily concerned with subtraction; we prototype to reduce uncertainty, to take away the unknown. </p><p>It's easy to forget the core value of subtraction when so much of design is about creating, and there's a lot that could be written (and certainly has) about how to frame design in subtraction terms. What's more interesting, perhaps, is how subtraction could be more of a unifying framework for ways of working that intersect with design, such as the Agile and Lean approaches we've been exploring, with others, more recently. </p><p>In each of these fields it's worth asking, "what are we trying to take away?" And in answering that question perhaps we get to a simpler set of principles through which to explore how we develop things of value in the best possible context. </p><p>In service design we are constantly trying to remove things: uncertainty around what to create, barriers to usage, walls between silos, misunderstanding of users' needs. Many of these things apply to Agile approaches too. A focus on functioning outputs seeks to remove uncertainty in a similar way to the prototypes of design. Agile also works hard to remove the organisational barriers, to eliminate as much as is possible the obstacles to trust and shared purpose.</p><p>And with Lean, we're working hard reduce waste, to unblock whatever stands in the way of creating value. We're trying to remove the internal and external blocks, as much as internal and external is still a valid way of viewing things. </p><p>In everything that seeks to create value in the widest sense, from the people we make things for to the teams that help make them, the true focus should be subtraction. It's possible to dig deeper into it, create lists, explore frameworks, but that wasn't the aim of this post. It was something I was thinking about and wanted to start writing down. It would be good to know what others think. </p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The more complex the unit of design, the less we are likely to question it. Simple products can be easily evaluated; when a bottle opener doesn't work we're happy to point to its flaws. But we rarely do this with systems, organisations, governments.</p><p>We rely on our direct relationship with things to provide our opportunity to critique them. My nan's relationship with democracy often came down to which doorstopping man looked the "nicest". That's not a criticism of her, it's simply a statement of how much mental energy we can all be bothered to expend on anything more abstract than that which we're shown.</p><p>Perhaps we judge our local government on whether our bins get collected. In democracy terms it's about as valid as the nice-looking man. In many cases this inability to think about anything bigger than our direct point of contact with something is used against us. Charities don't ask us to question whether the unit of a charity is the best way to help people in need, they just tell us the story of one person.</p><p>This blind acceptance of the core unit of design, whether it's a business or an entire system of democracy, changes over time. We're beginning to show a similar indifference to the fundamental existence of a whole new set of design units, from startups to platforms. And as with everything else we're falling for the actors without thinking about the play.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that most of the world's problems are directly caused by either:</p><p>A. A misunderstanding of economics <br />B. A misuse of economics</p><p>And yet, an understanding of economics seems to be incredibly rare, whether it's a general understanding we all share or the deep understanding we expect from those in charge.</p><p>Academia probably has a lot to do with the poor state of economics. Certainly when I was studying the progression routes seemed to be either further academic obscurity or working for a bank; academic fame versus making money from money.</p><p>And yet, what we really need economists for is to bring an interconnected logic to the world; to use an understanding of scarcity, cause and effect, equilibrium for a more worthwhile purpose than making money for other people or looking clever. </p><p>And most importantly it would be great if some of that understanding became embedded in our culture, so that when we're told a story about something in the press we can put it into context, maybe seek out the right information, relate it to other things. </p><p>How many of the worst periods in our history have exploited a lack of economic thinking? When we believe that the arrival of a few immigrants signals the collapse of our economy then something has gone very wrong.</p><p>I personally believe that economics is one of the best critical thinking subjects out there, and yet schools so often teach it as facts and figures, names and dates. We need people to come out of school able to take on the biggest issues we face, but we don't seem to be doing much to make that happen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was growing up the adults in my life often judged me on the basis of something they called common sense. For them it was some sort of unquestionable constant.</p><p>Its values helped them to assert their dominance over young people, children, me. Suffice to say, I lacked it. And the constant reminder that I lacked it contributed in no small part in my growth from an awkward, unsure child to an awkward, unsure teenager.</p><p>Common sense is all about the basics. Or at least the basics from the perspective of the adults I grew up with. Does this young person know how to sweep a driveway? Do they know how to hold a hammer? In other cultures theses things might not matter too much. In my circles they were the cornerstones.</p><p>And so, every time I swept a driveway, or held a hammer I felt eyes on me. Could I do the most basic jobs of humanity? I felt a heightened awareness of my inadequacy. I felt inferior, awkward. I couldn't even do the simple things. I most certainly lacked common sense.</p><p>Common sense is a great way to keep a hold over people. It gives you the capability high ground. Whatever else that person could do, from playing musical instruments to programming computers, if they lacked common sense then, well, what use were they?</p><p>Clinging to an idea of common sense is a brilliant defensive position. You can use it anywhere. See that clever person on the news? The scientist with the breakthrough? Probably not an ounce of common sense. And through that defence nobody can be better than you.</p><p>But common sense as a protective strategy is not what this post is about. It's what got me thinking about it: that sense of awkwardness, the constant thread of inadequacy it instills, and how it lingers. But then I realised that there's a wider issue.</p><p>The real issue is that we believe in a core set of knowledge at all. After all, beyond being able to survive, and reproduce (ironically one of the common sense things we prefer not to educate young people about), what actually is common sense?</p><p>And yet we build our whole society on a single body of knowledge. By a certain age there are things we must know. If our children don't know those things then they'll "fall behind". But the question is, "fall behind what?"</p><p>If the survival of the human species is dependent on everyone knowing solid arithmetic then we’re in luck. But I suspect that what we really need is people who couldn't care less about times tables; people who have no idea how to hold a hammer; people obsessed with honey bees, photons, the way sea currents manipulate the sea bed.</p><p>We need people with a complete lack of common sense.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Weight training works by pushing muscles to breaking point and then allowing them to recover, and grow. Formal education doesn't work this way. It supports and guides, providing children with a safe environment to acquire knowledge.

We already exerience information overload, so it seems pretty likely that a couple of key skills for our future society will be the ability to learn and the ability to filter.

So, how do we prepare children for this reality? Do we guide them through a supporting learning experience or do we throw them into chaos?

As my children flit from one project to the other, from one interest to the next, I've begun to realise that what they're learning isn't the topic itself but something more meta. They're exercising their learning muscles, learning to learn, learning to filter.

I'm understanding that I can't teach them what they want to know; instead they're developing the parts of their brains that help them to do that for themselves. And my role becomes much more about getting out of the way, much more about connecting them with the chaos.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Facebook's recent release of a standalone Group app and its less recent Messaging app are indicators of something important in the way we use social networks.

One of my least favourite things about social media is the way in which all new platforms perpetuate the follower or friend model; one of the obvious criticisms of something like Ello is that its architecture requires us to scale our connections. It wants to replicate Twitter or Facebook. Just without the ads. 

All new apps seem to want to replicate the fundamental dynamics of Twitter or Facebook. The thing is, the longer Twitter and Facebook go unchallenged, the harder it gets to compete with a platform that embeds itself more into our lives the longer we use it. 

So, one of the reasons Ello might not last is because few people want to rebuild what they already have on other platforms. We'll happily stare at a few ads to avoid the work of starting again. 

But Facebook's unbundling of its core functions, and purchase of companies like Whatsapp, are symptoms of an interesting paradox in the pervasive social network architecture. We're unwilling to throw away the hard-won networks of Facebook and Twitter but at the same time we don't find them terribly useful. 

So, apps that allow us to message individuals and groups, or create fluid groups based on interest, are popular because they make social networks genuinely useful. And they sit uneasily alongside the disengaged, Liking and Faving sprawl of the networks' core business. Until they get unbundled. 

It's no surprise that Facebook paid what it did for Whatsapp. It works, and its backbone is as lightweight as our mobile phone numbers can be.

Real competition for Facebook and Twitter isn't going to come from platforms like Ello, who insist on attacking the parts of the business that few people care enough about to reimagine. It'll come from things even better than Whatsapp, platforms that abandon the follower/friend model altogether and focus on meaningful usability and experience.

At some point, caring about how many friends and followers we have will be the preserve of the self-obsessed and the corporate. What really matters is what we can do; how we can embrace the fluidity of the web as a living stream, and make the most of it.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Blog commenting systems have evolved very little since their inception. One of the more interesting examples of some kind of evolution was Branch's inline commenting system; part of the platform's attempt to encourage thoughts-in-progress rather than finished pieces. 

Medium has similar functionality at the paragraph level but it fails to realise the potential due to its focus on polished editorial, and so the nearest thing we have to an unfinished ideas platform is Twitter. But still we rarely see the level of vulnerability and open thinking necessary to make it work there. 

The ability to share half-formed ideas is a vital thing. Face-to-face conversations  are built on these foundations. Without them we'd just be trading a series of pre-prepared monologues. And yet the internet still doesn't seem to effectively support this fundamental behaviour.

One of my favourite ideas development approaches is World Café. Its primary focus is to promote conversation, half-formed thoughts, as a means of drawing out the good stuff. To do that it encourages us to huddle together, relax, be human. 

But World Café isn't about just talking. It's designed to get our thoughts down, make them visible. And very little on the Internet comes close to this kind of all-in talking and doing.

The power of conversation in the right context is huge. Early conversations where ideas are hazy provide the true substance of individual and collective originality. They are the earliest prototypes of everything we do and they can take form with remarkable speed. 

But where are the digital enablers for what we instinctively know? Why are we building more and more platforms for fully-formed thoughts when we should be tackling the barriers to unguarded originality?

Is it that the business models for the internet are built around content? Do they require finished think-pieces to effectively commoditise our thoughts? Is it a technological failing? Or is it a fear of sharing our flimsiest, most fleeting thoughts that stops us from realising the  value of collective uncertainty?]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Open Data Camp</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last weekend I attended Open Data Camp in Winchester; my first ever "Camp". As someone who works primarily in design, attending designey events for designers, I'm not used to taking part in the more tech/data end of the events spectrum so I wanted to get my thoughts down.

I'm not going to go into the format or general organisation of the weekend. To me it seemed to go pretty smoothly. I knew where to be, when, and I got plenty to eat. We never ran out of coffee. I'd like to make particular mention of one of the brilliant organisers, Lucy Knight, not least because I'm lucky enough to work with her.

I attended a pretty diverse range of sessions: democracy, food, design, and mapping the benefits of open data. I enjoyed them all, although I repeatedly found that the conversation just started as the session ended. From past experience it's usually the case. As the first Open Data Camp it's probably more expected than in other, established events like GovCamp, but it's no bad thing; it helps to plot the course.

So, general experiences aside, a few things that stood out for me.

<h2>Public Sector Focus</h2>
It's inevitable that there will be a strong focus on the public sector in an event like Open Data Camp. Most discussion in the UK around Open Data is still heavily connected with the public sector. And to be honest, if the public sector didn't push on the open data thing who knows how far we'd have got by now.

My concern is around where we go next. For me, some of the most useful data, the most vital, is going to come from outside the public sector. Finding ways to get corporates to open up what they have is a difficult but worthwhile challenge and I feel like this needs to be pursued as aggressively, if not more so, as open data advocates are pursuing the public sector.

How can events like Open Data Camp help here? Is there a danger that the public sector focus makes it easier for private entities to slip the net? What are the routes in to these silos?

The other issues for me around the public sector focus is the potential for us to accept the public sector as it is. I was thinking about this in the session on democracy. With all the technology and data available to us is it enough to engage with machinations of democracy as they currently stand? How can technology, data (and design) help us to advance democracy at its most fundamental level?

<h2>Design and Data</h2>
I'm particularly interested in how to get data into the hands of designers and in fact I ran a session on this. It was a difficult one. The first thing I realised was that my definition of designer might not have been shared with everyone in the room. When we talk about data and design the natural common ground is web/app development. In this context it doesn't seem too much to expect designers to learn a bit of code and help bridge the gap that way.

But many designers are a long way from this. I have to remind myself that my interest in coding says more about me (geek) than the design profession as a whole and that the real common ground comes from creative ways to translate the essence of what each field is about. To this end I think I saw a card game in one of the sessions. We need more things like this. It would be remiss of me not to mention <a href="http://redfront.co.uk/blog/the-data-loop/" target="_blank">Redfront's own Data Loop</a> too.

<h2>Benefits</h2>
Martin Howitt ran a session on identifying the benefits of open data for different stakeholder groups. Bias aside (it appeals to my designer tendencies but I'm also lucky enough work with Martin as well) this seems to me to be a vital undertaking. If we're going to unlock the real potential of open data then we need more people to understand it, make use of it, demand it.

If you're interested in contributing to the benefits mapping of open data you can help by adding your comments <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RmAm9YTwsdiz25Fju_-RTFN4LG7SzZKhmNKm_HoAFJ4/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">to this spreadsheet</a>.

<h2>Hacking Together</h2>
One of the sessions I was in made me realise just how much work there is to be done in translating open data into useful things. There are some clever people out there doing clever things with data. There are challenges and hackathons that produce fascinating new applications. And yet the propagation, evolution and adoption of the outputs seems negligible in comparison.

From a biased designer's point of view I might say that the problem could lie in a missing human element. Are we successfully engaging and designing for the people who really need or want these apps? Could we do more to bring humanity into the process? As I talked about above, I'm passionate about the design component of open data, and as the technology landscape introduces new platforms and devices we need to be even surer that we're embarking on its exploration as a diverse groups of makers and users.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The more somebody builds a following for being knowledgable about a particular topic, the more they seem confident to be knowledgable about everything. At a certain scale of influence it's as if domain expertise becomes indistinguishable from general expertise. You could plot it on a graph: size of following versus scope of knowledge.

How much of this is in the eyes of the followers (they must be right about that because they're right about this) or in the mind of the thought-leader (I'm clever about this so what if I'm just generally clever?) is hard to know. But what is the impact of this correlation? In other words, what do the mechanics of this mean for the prevalence of particular opinions?

I think most importantly it leads to inappropriate certainty in subjects where there is very little certainty, and perhaps this is where it is most dangerous. On the whole, we're particularly uncomfortable with the unknown, so in many areas, if someone with the weight of public opinion beyond them articulates something definite then they're very likely to cement the opinions of a large crowd.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[How do we build design principles into the deepest architecture of things, into the algorithms and mechanisms?

It goes deeper than an ethos or mission. Those things change, get re-evaluated. Good intent can be reduced to a veneer while the core values are dismantled and exploited. 

But what if something couldn't exist at all without the complete set of design principles? Like a human body, every system present and functioning or no life at all. 

What are the means by which the architecture and the principles become inseparable? More importantly, how does this inseparability transcend enforcement and become a fundamental aspect of existence? ]]></content:encoded>
