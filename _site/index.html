<h2>Happiness and Systems</h2>
<p>“Happiness is not an output of things to be happy about. Sometimes this disconnection between the objective positives and the subjective emotion is the hardest thing, like two tectonic plates rubbing against each other: each of the same perceived origin but their friction making it worse.”</p>

<p>I’ve just been looking through my Evernote notes to try and pull together all the disparate pieces of what I’d done over the last year with some kind of editing in mind. Every now and again I like to try and rationalise what I’m currently doing, what’s been left lying around and what is exciting me now; it helps to try and find a narrative in all of it, some semblance of a clear way forward.</p>

<p>Anyway, one of my notes was simply the quote above, which I just read a couple of times. I probably wrote it as the start of a blog post but it never got that far. I have a lot of those kinds of note. Some of them I’ve tackled in other ways; some of them don’t even make sense to me now, like my own bad handwriting. But this one still makes sense.</p>

<p>Happiness is often strongly related to the manifestation of things that should make us happy. And we still talk as if that connection should be obvious. It seems odd when people are happy despite terrible things in their lives, or unhappy in the face of great things: things we might be jealous of. It seems broken somehow.</p>

<p>But my original note wasn’t about that. Hopefully as we gain more experience of being human it’s all too easy to understand how things, situations, people don’t necessarily make us happy. Our emotions can be influenced by what’s outside our heads but it’s not a direct link. We get to know that, even if we forget.</p>

<p>No, the original note was about some kind of multiplier effect. Being unhappy in the face of the raw ingredients of happiness brings its own kind of misery. Why are we unhappy when we should be? Are we ungrateful? Now perhaps we can add the unhappiness of guilt into the mix.</p>

<p>Happiness is a system and systems have their own rules. Just because all the pieces are in place doesn’t mean that the system will work. As much as the original thing I wrote was some sort of reflection on happiness I now think it’s about something far more general and difficult.</p>

<p>Almost everything we learn in life is telling us that bigger things are made up of smaller things; that little steps will get us to the end goal. But what if this is true far less often than we’d like to think? Maybe breaking things down into their composite elements just breaks them; and isn’t just ineffective but actually counter-productive.</p>

<p>Instead of attempting to orchestrate all the little things that I grapple with on a regular basis I’m going to spend next year trying to approach things with this single reflection in mind. Instead of believing that I can organise the components I’m going to think more about how I progress the systems. It may seem the more difficult option but if my note about happiness applies elsewhere than it has every chance of being more successful than the alternative.</p>
