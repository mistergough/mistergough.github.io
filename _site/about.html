	<h2>About</h2>
        <em></em>
    	<p>I’m a design facilitator whose work converges on three overlapping areas: interactions, systems and self.</p>

<p>The majority of my work is carried out through <a href="http://redfront.co.uk">Redfront</a>, my human interaction agency. In addition to working for clients I spend my time creating new tools for design, and sharing them with people; I’ve recently been involved with design projects for data, legal contracts, agile methodology and sharing startups.</p>

<p>Through Redfront I regularly work on self-directed “Discovery” projects; the latest is exploring the intersection of <a href="https://medium.com/design-and-economics">Design and Economics</a>. These Discovery projects feed into my client work and teaching (I’m a lecturer in service design, organisation design and systems at Ravensbourne in London.</p>

<p>Redfront’s Discovery project for data led to (among other things) my co-founding <a href="https://thedata.place/">The Data Place</a> (as well as Open Data Institute Node <a href="http://devon.theodi.org">ODI Devon</a>). The Data Place is a social enterprise bringing together human-centred design and open source technologies to foster thriving people and places through data.</p>

<p>The connection between people, places, technology and data is a major theme of my work. In 2015 I helped to run the conference <a href="http://beyond.place/btsc15/">Beyond the Smart City</a> which explored a more connected, sustainable, human vision for Smart Cities. We’ve continued to work on inclusive technology and data through <a href="http://things.camp/">ThingsCamp</a>, which has taken place all over the UK, including <a href="https://medium.com/thingscamp/thingscamp-3-5-and-prototyping-what-matters-54f69c69c79f">at the V&amp;A</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://theself.agency">The Self Agency</a>, which launched in April 2016 in Barcelona, is an opportunity to explore a real focus on the self and how this foundation can help support more human-scale projects. There’s a <a href="https://published.theself.agency/">Medium Publication</a> if you’re interested in some of the thinking behind it and we’ve also been <a href="https://soundcloud.com/the-self-agency">podcasting</a>. One of the outputs of this work is a series of <a href="https://medium.com/redfront/design-for-agency-at-hyper-island-34807f28726b">workshops for Hyper Island</a> in Manchester.</p>

<p>Aside from work I write a <a href="http://theminimallist.com">long-running blog</a> with my wife about more intentional living. I’m also developing <a href="http://learningoutsiders.com">online resources for unschooling</a>, although there’s a long way to go with that.</p>

<p>If you want to talk to me about anything at all then <a href="https://twitter.com/mistergough">Twitter</a> is often the best place to get started. If you want to make a more formal enquiry into how we could work together then <a href="http://mistergough.com/contact/">there’s a form</a>. Let’s go from there.</p>
