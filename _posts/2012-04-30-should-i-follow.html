<p>Sometimes it's hard to put the effort necessary into deciding whether to follow someone on Twitter. For those times when I'm a bit pushed I use a simple reference for making the decision. It's purely based on the numbers of Followers and Followees so it's not very scientific. For those of you that want to be equally unscientific I've provided a chart.</p>
<p>Obviously this is under development so if you have any stereotypes to add please let me know. Once finished I hope it will save me the job of reading the tweets of anyone I don't know.</p>
