<p>It's getting increasingly difficult to come up with clever answers for my children's endless questions about Santa. So I thought I'd enlist Quora. Below are what I believe to be the key issues in the Santa story, all posed as questions on Quora. Your answers would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Please feel free to add questions in the comments and I'll publish them.</p>
