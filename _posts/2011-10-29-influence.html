<p>I've been thinking about social influence for a while and I'm certainly not the only one. What the launch of new services all the time (Kred being the most recent one I know of) it seems that the market is developing at quite a pace.</p>
<p>But I saw a comment from someone recently that really made me stop and think. They were saying that in the future people would pay people for endorsements on the basis of their influence and I immediately had two thoughts:</p>
<p>1) I'm sure this is true.</p>
<p>2) It shouldn't be.</p>
<p>No two people are every going to agree how social influence works. Social business/media/commerce/networking/recruitment or whatever you're involved in are in a permanent state of flux. I wouldn't expect anyone to come out with the definitive, right or wrong answer on most topics in these fields but to me, the idea of paid influencer endorsements not only misses the whole point of social influence but is also symbolic of a wider misunderstanding of social.</p>
<p>The most famous examples of endorsements we have right now are those of celebrities. We don't bat an eyelid seeing David Beckam adding his name to aftershave, or marker pens, or trainers. And there's a reason for that. No matter what you think of David Beckham, his adverts for Sharpie do no harm to his standing as a football player. His reputation is built upon sporting prowess and extensions to his personal brand, made possible from his celebrity, do no harm to what makes him a celebrity in the first place.</p>
<p>The thing is, there's no such duality in social media. Influence on social media is built on trust. Whether or not you feel that you can measure that influence (and this is not a topic for this blog post), there's no doubt that cashing in on that influence is mutually destructive. It would be naive to suggest that there is no such thing as influence, clearly some people reach and affect more people than others. But it is not a commodity. The whole point of social, its core value, is that trust has to be earned and not bought. No the market is not perfect, and it's possible to build a great deal of influence out of very little integrity, but as I said before, the whole thing is in flux. At the heart of social is an understanding that, hopefully, these deceptive wrinkles will be ironed out and trust will win the day.</p>
<p>So, for me, the idea of monetising influence is shaky ground. I've no doubt that in the short term there's money to be made. But in the long term an unsophisticated adoption of this strategy is doomed to failure. i say unsophisticated becuase</p>
