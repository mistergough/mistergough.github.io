I hate going to the dentist. Or at least I hate the thought of going to the dentist. It actually turns out to be pretty bearable when I get there; except that the fear of going stops me rediscovering that. In fact, for maybe seven or eight years I completely avoided going to the dentist. And the longer I stayed away, the more difficult it became to face going.

During that time, those years of avoidance, I worried constantly. I spent every day thinking about what might happen if I actually got to the dentist. I created scenarios in my head, eventually coming to the conclusion that I’d be having all my teeth out, that nothing was salvageable. It’s amazing what you can piece together in your head from substantial worry and scant fact.

You may or may not be surprised to discover that when I actually got the dentist after all those years it turned out not to be all that bad at all. In a short space of time all my apprehension vanished. And now I don’t think about it any more. Dentistry is no longer a pre-occupation.

The thing is, my days are not filled with shiny white joy. I haven’t substituted the perpetual stress with boundless happiness. Which, in some ways, is surprising to me. After all, when I had the worry I believed that sorting things out would change my life. I fantasised about having overcome my fear. And now, when I look back, I realise that I’d pretty much accepted the state of things before. 

Everything consistent ultimately becomes normal. If I reflect on the period of change, of going from apprehension to relief, I can only pick out a short interlude of joy and excitement; for maybe a day or so I was going around with a grin on my face. Most of what went before and came after essentially flatlines on the emotional graph.

What have I learned from all this? Firstly, I’ve realised just how much I can accept in my daily life, how easy it is to live with exceptional circumstances. It’s a survival instinct, being able to cope. But it’s also a barrier to change. If I hadn’t assimilated the worry I’d maybe have done something about it sooner.

Secondly, the future isn’t really worth fantasising about. However much I imagine something to have an impact on my life indefinitely, it’s just not true. The most terrible things, the most exciting things, can become normal. After the initial blip, it will all settle down. I might have moments of realisation, thinking to myself how great or badly things are going, but over time those moments will have to be forced.

Finally, the initial blip is what it’s fundamentally all about. The only normality that creates a constant impact is continual change. Whether it's through tackling fears, switching contexts, learning new things, or just abandoning long-established habits; it's the variety, perceived difficulty and pace of change that matters. Everything else becomes background.
