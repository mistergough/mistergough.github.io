<p>How do we build design principles into the deepest architecture of things, into the algorithms and mechanisms?</p>
<p>It goes deeper than an ethos or mission. Those things change, get re-evaluated. Good intent can be reduced to a veneer while the core values are dismantled and exploited. </p>
<p>But what if something couldn't exist at all without the complete set of design principles? Like a human body, every system present and functioning or no life at all. </p>
<p>What are the means by which the architecture and the principles become inseparable? More importantly, how does this inseparability transcend enforcement and become a fundamental aspect of existence? </p>
