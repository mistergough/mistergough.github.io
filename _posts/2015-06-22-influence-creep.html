<p>The more somebody builds a following for being knowledgable about a particular topic, the more they seem confident to be knowledgable about everything. At a certain scale of influence it's as if domain expertise becomes indistinguishable from general expertise. You could plot it on a graph: size of following versus scope of knowledge.</p>
<p>How much of this is in the eyes of the followers (they must be right about that because they're right about this) or in the mind of the thought-leader (I'm clever about this so what if I'm just generally clever?) is hard to know. But what is the impact of this correlation? In other words, what do the mechanics of this mean for the prevalence of particular opinions?</p>
<p>I think most importantly it leads to inappropriate certainty in subjects where there is very little certainty, and perhaps this is where it is most dangerous. On the whole, we're particularly uncomfortable with the unknown, so in many areas, if someone with the weight of public opinion beyond them articulates something definite then they're very likely to cement the opinions of a large crowd.</p>
