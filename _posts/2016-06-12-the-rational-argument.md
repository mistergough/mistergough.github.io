As the EU Referendum approaches, the arguments on social media, for in and for out, are reaching fever pitch; in recent days I’ve seen an explosion in long form, economics-based posts that aim to persuade potential Leave voters to Remain.

Whilst I applaud this valiant effort to navigate the complexity of the European Union and present the facts as objectively as possible I can’t help feeling that it’s all a lost cause; to me it seems like the people on opposing sides are speaking different languages.

But the European project is important to me and so I wanted to find a way that we might be able to understand each other. I wanted to see if now, in the face of a possible Brexit, I might  find a way to combine facts and rationale with ignorance and racism to present an argument that genuinely touches hearts and minds.

Recent news stories have provided some perfect material for my argument. From the rise of far right political parties to football hooliganism, the facts are falling into place. There are clearly pockets of ignorance, racism, selfishness, misguided imperialism and thuggery all over Europe. Far from being traits unique to a section of the British population, these are traits shared by groups—however small—everywhere.

The question is, do we really want to further these qualities as an isolated nation or could we work together? Think how much these narrow-minded individuals might gain by coordinating their efforts. Conversely, imagine just how much more difficult it might be to present a united front in general stupidity if our freedom to travel around Europe is restricted, and Britain has to cultivate its own moronic world view without the benefit of others’.

When your opportunity to vote is finally here might I ask you to stop and think, just for a moment, and picture a united Europe, working together despite our differences on a grand union of idiots. In fact, why stop at Europe? The whole world is full of complete twits, an endless opportunity for bigots and racists of every persuasion to join forces and unite. Never mind the economic arguments. Never mind the facts. Just listen to your heart.
