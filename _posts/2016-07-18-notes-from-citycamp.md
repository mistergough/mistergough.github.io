Some months ago I started a small conversation as part of CityCamp Birmingham at the Impact Hub. The topic of discussion was “What is Human Infrastructure?”, which is a pretty broad topic, and it wasn’t possible to get too far into it, but I decided shortly after the event to write up the thinking behind it. So here’s an attempt to do that.

Our current interest in Design Thinking is a Good Thing in general terms, but what we mean by those two words and how we apply them can be fundamentally different for everyone. As such, the following ideas (and opinions) are a general way of thinking about people and things, and how design best serves the former rather than the latter. Some of my previous posts are around similar themes, but here I am having another go at it.

## What Might Human Infrastructure Be?
I wanted to use this title as a starting point because I keep coming back to this in just about everything. I’m interested in how focusing on human beings as a central idea isn’t just a way of designing things better, but is actually a reminder to stop designing the wrong things altogether.

Perhaps a good way into the topic is to consider three levels of humans and infrastructure, breaking things down but also considering where each perspective is currently (or could be) applied.

### 1. Humanised Infrastructure
We’re probably all relatively familiar with Humanised Infrastructure: the better-known work of designers; making things more usable, more human. Humanised Infrastructure is “softening” the edges and enabling the things we need to fit better in the spaces between us.

Interestingly, this is still the default mode for almost all design. As much as we talk about the evolution of design in recent years—and its inroads into new areas—we are still largely  at this level. We may have improved the tools for humanising things but the framework in which those tools sit (the industrial design model) has changed little.

Some of the more recent design disciplines, such as service design, blur the boundaries between this category and the next, but we still often view products and services as modifiable, malleable and user-centred rather than secondary considerations or simply not required at all.

### 2. Infrastructure for Humans
At this level design becomes more deliberately participatory. Infrastructure for Humans puts people at the heart of what is being made: not just involving them in the design process but enabling them to drive the design process (and in many cases the delivery). This level of design might, for example, encompass some open design and platform approaches, but also more deeply human-centred ways of doing product and service design.

The vital difference between this category and the previous is the focus. While the previous level seeks to humanise a given entity, this level seeks to create an entity that serves the needs of people. But as much as this level of approach seems to be the ideal, I’d rather consider it an intermediate phase between the first category and something else altogether.

The conceptual issue here is that even allowing for everything to be created, or changed, around the needs of people is still infrastructure-as-entity focused. And so, as much as this may seem like a much better method of designing, it’s still rooted in traditional design models.

### 3. Humans as Infrastructure
The approaches I talked about up to this point cover most of what is visibly and recognisably design, and they all have something in common: each approach “harnesses” humans to create things, even if those things are designed with humans at their core.

But instead of thinking about how we create infrastructure for humans, what if humans themselves were the infrastructure? How would this different perspective change the way we thought about design? It may seem like an arbitrary point of difference, but the focus of design ultimately becomes what we design. If we design better things for people we’re still designing things for (and with) people. And so a shift from design for people instead of things for people enables us to change the design perspective and the outcomes.

Infrastructure by its nature can’t keep pace with humans. The things we build—no matter how well designed—are a legacy as soon as they are created. To overcome this maybe we can work to make things as flexible as possible, to adapt, but if the best way to stop infrastructure calcifying is to make it as lightweight and changeable as possible then the ultimate expression of this is surely nothing at all. And if the focus of design is “nothing” then what of design?

## Design for Narrative
Instead of designing the things between people, Design for Narrative is about design for the ability of people to employ what they need in the pursuit of what they need or want. This is a difficult concept as it deliberately set out to avoid designing the things we normally consider important. But this shift in thinking is important if we are to adapt design to new applications that require faster design than current models can cope with.

Design for Narrative can be as simple as improving access to the means for people to make and use their own tools. But we should also consider how we foster the collective context. For example, how do we design for people to better create their shared future narratives?

Design for Context in some ways is the very opposite of user-centred design. User-Centred design seeks (in its better applications) to empower individuals to get the best possible outcomes for themselves. However, I wouldn’t be the first person to wrote about the obvious limitations of this narrow focus on the user-provider model.

Design for Context approaches things differently. It looks at how we design a healthy, enabling environment that in itself encourages people to imagine an even better, healthy, enabling environment. It provides the space for people to find the best solutions without those solutions needing to exist. After all, if the focus of design is no longer the solution then we’re less likely to design solutions into permanent existence.

## Design for Motivation
Design for Motivation is similarly tricky: we might talk about Intrinsic Motivation but how much do we understand about the challenges of designing for this? I’ve had a number of conversations recently where Design for Motivation was the primary difficulty facing someone; whether that be their own motivation or the motivation of people they work with.

On one hand, the idea of moving from designing products, services, organisations and infrastructure to designing the means by which people have free reign to create them might seem like a major leap. In reality, however, what it really takes is practical application. Iterative processes and reflection make it easier to understand how things like context and motivation can be designed for, but reflection and iteration require intent and critical thinking.

## The Direction of Travel
One of the hardest things to do with design is to decide where the thinking stops. Every design decision has almost infinite implications and design generally avoids being unwieldy by staying focused on specific areas. However, at some point, unless your focus is absolutely relentless, your field of design expands beyond itself into another and you start to see where things are complementary or conflicting.

So I sometimes wonder if we practice, learn, teach design the wrong way round. By approaching design at the level of a discipline or an application and then expanding outwards to the bigger questions we might find ourselves expecting the bigger questions to be all about improving our specific application of design instead of questioning whether we need it at all.

In this way, we can never avoid creating humanised infrastructure, or infrastructure for humans at best. No matter what level of exploration we undertake we assume that the exploration is merely a means of enabling us to make our narrow field better. For me, this looks like how people learn philosophy: we start at school with learning to read and write, then we gradually get better at manipulating language until we’re able to understand complex philosophies. But maybe this is why so much of the philosophy I’ve read is concerned with language itself. What if we learned philosophy first and then decided what next? Where would this take us?

Perhaps this is what keeps us making things nobody needs. No matter how big the question we ask ourselves the answer comes down to something we already know, because that’s how we got there in the first place. If we really want to humanise everything than maybe we need to start in a different place. Hence why the idea of Humans as Infrastructure, no matter how odd that may seem, provides me at least with another perspective, another starting point.
