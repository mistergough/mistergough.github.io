Last month I was lucky enough to take part in CityCamp Birmingham, hosted at the now legendary Impact Hub. Not really knowing what to expect I prepared more for a conversation than any kind of presentation and so, rather than having a slide deck, I have a series of notes that it might be worth sharing.

The topic of my talk was “What is Human Infrastructure?”, which is a pretty broad topic; so rather than attempt to pull it all into one, coherent narrative I’m going to lay it out here semi-organised and see where it goes.

I kicked off by introducing myself; something I find increasingly difficult. I suspect that it’s the same for a lot of people. My attempt to summarise who/what I am was more than just an introduction: it was a core theme of the session. This difficulty comes from a legacy of seeing our workselves as always part of something else, rather than our work being part of ourselves.

When I introduce myself I naturally want to tell people about the functions I perform; I define myself by my intended usefulness in different roles rather than by what I care about or what I want to do. I try to define myself by the things around me rather than by myself.

## So What Might Human Infrastructure Be?

I wanted to use this title as a starting point because the thinking around it is becoming common to all the things I’m working on. I’m interested in how focusing on human beings as a central idea isn’t just a way of designing things better, but is actually a reminder to stop designing the wrong things altogether.

I talked about some of the things that inspired me here, particularly unschooling, and the writing of people like Ivan Illich who talked about the paradox of institutions that are designed to served us but inevitably serve nothing but themselves.

Taking this as a starting point it suggests that the best organisation is no organisation, but that also seems incredibly defeatist. If we can’t scale anything then where does it leave us? So I started to talk about three levels of humans and infrastructure, to help break down the topic into some practical, actionable ideas.

### 1. Humanised Infrastructure

Design-as-moulding where much of the world’s current design work focuses. In other words, a lot of what design is doing is on a spectrum between tweaking things and fully optimising around users or customers. Implicit within the spectrum is often a belief that this range of options covers everything.

### 2. Infrastructure for Humans

Design-as-collaboration: co-designing with people from scratch. This recognises users/customers/citizens as key stakeholders and builds with them. The fundamental difference here is that the organisation, product or service is not a given.  A new entity that facilitates the delivery of the design is entirely feasible. 

This may seem like the perfect, equitable method of designing, but this is still rooted in traditional design models.

### 3. Humans as Infrastructure

The approaches I talked about up to here cover most of what is visibly design, and it all has something in common: each approach harnesses humans to create things, even if those things are well-designed for humans. And so people become servants to infrastructure, whether they’re consuming or creating it.

Design as participation but participation in what? This is the key thing. In both of the above our objective is to design a “thing”. Whether it’s a given thing or entirely new thing it’s where design takes us.

And yet, infrastructure by its nature can’t keep pace with humans, it calcifies.

So rationalising, structuring things becomes and obsession. We try to empty our entire brains out and transform into infrastructure. We don’t trust the internalised world.

What does it mean for infrastructure if we bring the whole person?

Human infrastructure treats humans as the hard edges. From a service design perspective this means more sophisticated interfaces.

Existing infrastructure is driven by outdated business models. What of user needs if you’re subjugating people for your own benefit?

Radical monopoly.

Skipping the needs for externally driven transformation. Do we need the “other”?

Design as motivation and interactions/interfaces.

## What do we need?
For me the most important change needed is to place a much greater emphasis on design for context and design for motivation.

### Design for Context

### Design for Motivation

### Design for Reduction

A different language because language is important.

Different models of design. We have a current understanding of design being one thing, made popular by approaches like Design Thinking.

Ways we work.

Interface design for individual embodiment.

Design of contexts.

Design for intrinsic motivation.

A meaningful redefining of throwaway.

Different time cycles of design.

Design for deep connections (language, mental models, conversation with Indy).
