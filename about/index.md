I'm a design facilitator whose work converges on three overlapping areas: interactions, systems and self.

The majority of my work is carried out through [Redfront](http://redfront.co.uk), my human interaction agency. In addition to working for clients I spend my time creating new tools for design, and sharing them with people; I’ve recently been involved with design projects for data, legal contracts, agile methodology and sharing startups.

Through Redfront I regularly work on self-directed “Discovery” projects; the latest is exploring the intersection of [Design and Economics](https://medium.com/design-and-economics). These Discovery projects feed into my client work and teaching (I’m a lecturer in service design, organisation design and systems at Ravensbourne in London.

Redfront’s Discovery project for data led to (among other things) my co-founding [The Data Place](https://thedata.place/) (as well as Open Data Institute Node [ODI Devon](http://devon.theodi.org)). The Data Place is a social enterprise bringing together human-centred design and open source technologies to foster thriving people and places through data.

The connection between people, places, technology and data is a major theme of my work. In 2015 I helped to run the conference [Beyond the Smart City](http://beyond.place/btsc15/) which explored a more connected, sustainable, human vision for Smart Cities. We’ve continued to work on inclusive technology and data through our [ThingsCamp](http://things.camp/), which have taken place all over the UK, including [at the V&A](https://medium.com/thingscamp/thingscamp-3-5-and-prototyping-what-matters-54f69c69c79f).

[The Self Agency](http://theself.agency), which launched in April 2016 in Barcelona, is an opportunity to explore a real focus on the self and how this foundation can help support more human-scale projects. There’s a [Medium Publication](https://published.theself.agency/) if you’re interested in some of the thinking behind it and we’ve also been [podcasting](https://soundcloud.com/the-self-agency). One of the outputs of this work is a series of [workshops for Hyper Island](https://medium.com/redfront/design-for-agency-at-hyper-island-34807f28726b) in Manchester.

Aside from work I write a [long-running blog](http://theminimallist.com) with my wife about more intentional living. I’m also developing [online resources for unschooling](http://learningoutsiders.com), although there’s a long way to go with that.

If you want to talk to me about anything at all then [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mistergough) is often the best place to get started. If you want to make a more formal enquiry into how we could work together then [there’s a form](http://mistergough.com/contact/). Let’s go from there.
