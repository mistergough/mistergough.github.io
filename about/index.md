I'm Simon Gough and this is my personal blog, generally with some kind of design, technology, learning, anarchy theme.

Most of my work is done through [Redfront](http://redfront.co.uk), a human-centred design agency with an interest in new models and applications of design. We like making things, and making things that help other people make things.

I also run [imagetext](http://imagetext.co.uk), working on the ocassional digital design project. I like to do things collaboratively. I actually wrote [a post about that](http://mistergough.com/2014/03/29/the-lone-designer.html).

Since 2009 I've co-written [The Minimal List](http://theminimallist.com), a blog about family, minimalism, learning and adventure. We're just about to relaunch with a bit less minimalism and fewer lists.

The learning thing is particularly important. Our [Learning Outsiders](http://learningoutsiders.com) project is currently working on ways of taking the themes of unschooling to a wider audience.

I'm a co-founder of Open Data Institute Node [ODI Devon](http://devon.theodi.org) where, among other things, we're working on more human and sustainable approaches to smart technologies. Check out [Beyond](http://beyond.place) for more of that.

Finally, I'm a very amateur photographer so here's [my Flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mistergough/). I'm hoping to improve.
