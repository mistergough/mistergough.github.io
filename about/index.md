I'm Simon Gough and this is my personal blog for posts that don't belong elsewhere, generally with some kind of design, technology, learning, civil disobedience theme.

Most of my work is done through [Redfront](http://redfront.co.uk), a human-centred design agency with an interest in new models and applications of design.

I also run [imagetext](http://imagetext.co.uk), working on the occasional digital design project. I like to do things collaboratively. I actually wrote [a post about that](http://mistergough.com/2014/03/29/the-lone-designer.html).

Since 2009 I've co-written [The Minimal List](http://theminimallist.com), a blog about family, minimalism, learning and adventure. We're just about to relaunch with a bit less minimalism and fewer lists.

The learning thing is particularly important. Our [Learning Outsiders](http://learningoutsiders.com) project is currently working on ways of taking the themes of unschooling to a wider audience.

I'm a co-founder of Open Data Institute Node [ODI Devon](http://devon.theodi.org) where, among other things, we're working on more human and sustainable approaches to smart technologies. Check out [Beyond](http://beyond.place) for more.

Finally, I'm a very amateur photographer so here's [my Flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mistergough/). I'm hoping to improve.
