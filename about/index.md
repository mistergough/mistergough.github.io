Hello. I'm Simon and I'm a design facilitator. I live in Barcelona and do lots of different things with a common thread: helping people use design to make things better.

My main thing is [Redfront](http://redfront.co.uk) where for many years I've been bringing design approaches to pretty much everything, using existing tools and making new ones. There are a few things you can download and use yourself on the website.

I love doing interesting projects with good people. Right now I'm working on  [Beyond](http://beyond.place), bringing together design, technology and data in the pursuit of something rather more human and creative than smart cities.

I'm also co-developing [The Self Agency](http://theself.agency), which will launch next April in Barcelona. I'll write more about that soon.

I've been a coder and visual designer for over twenty years. It influences all my work to some extent but I also do the occasional design and build project through [imagetext](http://imagetext.co.uk). I like elegant, open source approaches that function.

While exploring the connection between human-centred design and data I accidentally became a co-founder of Open Data Institute Node [ODI Devon](http://devon.theodi.org). I even went as far as becoming a [Registered Trainer](http://theodi.org/training_team).

The human-centred data fascination is currently becoming a book, with the first version coming out soon. If that sounds interesting you can join [the mailing list](http://eepurl.com/br95wv).

I've worked with students for many years and I'm currently course tutor for the MDes in Service Design at Ravensbourne.

On a more personal note I've been using a blog to document my family's slow escape from our previous way of life. That blog, which we started in 2009 is called [The Minimal List](http://theminimallist.com).

For a while now I've been sharing [my attempt to become healthier](http://misterscoff.wordpress.com), although the posts tend to go off on a tangent. It's mainly about food though, which is broad enough a topic to keep me going. 

A lot of the above means that I need to write a lot. And over the past few years I've written a lot more. I think it's something I'd like to pursue in a more organised way so I'm always happy to get tips on that.

Finally, I'd really like to become a better photographer although I don't get to spend a lot of time on it. I'm always happy to receive [constructive criticism](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mistergough/).
