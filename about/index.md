I'm a facilitator with an interest in design models, trying to better match ways of designing with the outcomes we want and over the past few years my work has converged on three, overlapping areas: interactions, systems and self.

[Redfront](http://redfront.co.uk) is a human-centred design agency, which I've been part of for over fifteen years. In addition to working for clients I spend my time creating new tools for design and sharing them with people. We've recently been involved with design projects for data, legal contracts, agile methodology and sharing startups.

As part of Redfront's human-centred data work I'm currently writing a book. The first version, with new tools and approaches for designing with data, will be out very soon. If you're interested you can join [the mailing list](http://eepurl.com/br95wv). The data exploration also led to me becoming a co-founder of Open Data Institute Node [ODI Devon](http://devon.theodi.org).

[Beyond](http://beyond.place) is looking at how a better understanding of smart systems can support more sustainable ways of living and working. We're bringing together technology and data with design principles to blur the boundaries between smart cities, smart rural and something more meaningful. There's [a post about it on the ODI website](http://theodi.org/blog/beyond-smart-city-data-infrastructure-devon).

[The Self Agency](http://theself.agency), which will launch next April in Barcelona, is an opportunity to explore a real focus on the individual and how this foundation can help support more human-scale projects.

Finally, I'm about to begin as course tutor for the MDes in Service Design at Ravensbourne College in London.
