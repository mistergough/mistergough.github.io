<p>I blog all over the place - for my work, for others, for projects. But this is where I write the random stuff. If you're looking for themes then you could look at the following places (not all my own work, some of them just a sprinkling):</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Redfront" href="http://redfront.co.uk" target="_blank">Redfront</a> - my main business. Service Design, stuff with post-it notes, making things;</li>
<li><a title="The Minimal List" href="http://theminimallist.com" target="_blank">The Minimal List</a> - a long-running blog about simplicity I write with my wife;</li>
<li><a title="imagetext" href="http://imagetext.co.uk" target="_blank">imagetext</a> - my visual design business. I do graphic identities and clean, simple websites;</li>
<li><a title="Learning Outsiders" href="http://learningoutsiders.com" target="_blank">Learning Outsiders</a> - a work in progress, imagining a world without school, to make education better;</li>
<li><a title="Our Learning Website" href="http://http://learningoutsiders.com/ourlearningwebsite/" target="_blank">Our Learning Website</a> - where we do fun projects while everyone else is at school;</li>
<li><a title="Handemic" href="http://handemic.com" target="_blank">Handemic</a> - doing mobile apps stuff; and</li>
<li><a title="pop_up" href="http://http://popuphq.com/" target="_blank">pop_up</a> - not my idea. A project for creatives and geeks, started by Phillippa Rose, the other Redfront person.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, there are lots of different things going on, but there is a simple idea running through it all. I like to make things better, simpler and for people. If you've made it this far why not follow me on <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/mistergough" target="_blank">Twitter</a>?</p>
